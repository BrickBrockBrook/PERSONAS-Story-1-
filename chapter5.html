<h2>Chapter 5. Maroon Devil</h2>

<p>A hand, that is what one can see reach out from that portal, a hand of someone unknown, but yet was different, not like any of those creatures called COTS for the hand or like anyone one can find when there really isn’t anyone else for majority fled to what Sans called Hotland or The Core, nor any for what Bendy has only gave a brief description of what he called ‘inky’. So for someone to step out when yet many universes could be in danger is certainly different, was it to escape? Maybe to join the chaos? Who knows, but yet the wandering thoughts get interrupted by Bendy who hit a bit into Brook and spoke up in a whisper as if to be sure they won’t hear despite being the only three in the library that is Brook, Bendy and Sans. “Who is that?? Is this the person that’s causing the bad stuff?” Brook shrugged to what Bendy asked, which Sans seemed to take a moment to check the window finding a way to open it and opens it a little that let in cold air right away into here but yet can hear now what is going on outside, which caused the three now to focus on what’s going on out there. </p>

<p>The three then seeing what first was a black fingerless gloved hand that came out, then the leg looking to be wearing a rino colored gray boots and a iron gray for the pants they seem to wear, then came out the rest of them, wearing a maroon hood that the hood part was up with the horns piercing through holes in it that are quite tall but not to tall currently, with a pattern on the hood being what replicates massive scars in a watermelon color all across the hood, while yet can see the black fingerless gloves they wore and a tail they seem to have that looked like the head of an arrow but pitch black, often how one may believe devils to have for a shaping like that. Seeing how this maroon devil to call them looked from left to right, checking their surroundings able to hardly see there face due to the hood except how there maroon eyes seemed to glow under it, having almost like a similar face to Bendy’s except the eyes are yet different and nor there was a smile really and yet appeared what looks like lines that go down from their eyes and down the face, who was this person is what begged the question. </p>

<p>This maroon devil seemed to check around carefully to their surroundings, the portal sitting open behind them, till shouting can be heard from a voice familiar to the three that made them all look to attempt to see from how much the window allows them to watching as seeing DDraig seemed to rush over with what seems like a smile but still a worried expression and tackle hugged the maroon devil which startled the maroon devil hearing then a quite low voice that had an echo to it be yet spoke from them saying a “Let go, DDraig.” which made DDraig do so, making it clear they know one another just by even the shouting that was hard to make out from DDraig, probably giving more to the theory of if this person is the cause. “Who is this guy?” Bendy seemed to ask in a whisper tone in case for if they heard or not, which both Brook and Sans shrugged, which caused the three to watch again now to see what could be learned of who these people are. “Stiex! Oh gee- what are you even doing here!?? It’s not even safe to be here let alone anywhere else! Unless it’s uh- a way to escape from him…” DDraig seemed to ask the maroon devil that is learned to be called Stiex, who seemed to just look at him listening to what was said, able to have quite the quick response to it. </p>

<p>“Here for more something else, since that fuck is more caught up in causing shit then that, need to talk to you about something” Stiex explained which left DDraig with a confused yet still such a worried look that yet remained on his face all the time it does appear to be, which though when hearing the swearing made Bendy speak up in an annoyed tone, “Sheesh does he really gotta go swearing like that!?? Harsh!” Sans then shushed Bendy so he could hear the conversation outside which caused Bendy and even Brook to begin to listen as well having to catch up on what they’re saying. “Tell me it's not bad now!..” seemed DDraig was rambling and had to catch up on what he was saying, seeming clear he’s worried what this Stiex fellow has to say. “Depends on how you view it. Look, by dusk back at ‘home’ something is going to happen, Which I am going to need you to be sure no harm goes to the rest cause of it. Knowing the four will flee back there as a celebration by then, issues can be handled with.” Stiex seemed to explain leaving DDraig confused by what he meant, as if this isn’t usual to happen now, quite interesting to even say. “Stiex, What do you mean?... Are you going to-” “DDraig, if I say it I know you’re going to fucking panic more then a rabbit sensing something harmless they see as danger.” Stiex interrupted DDraig who seemed to look down with an expression that surely showed Stiex spoke the truth of sorts, which made Stiex study it then speak up again, checking around the area. </p>

<p>“Look, Here is something to note, Four screams. Hear Four of them when back there with the rest, leave the building, go as far as you possibly can, hide for hell's sake, Even if one is my own.” DDraig stared at Stiex once Stiex had explained something, which caused the three to look at one another in curiosity on what that could mean then back to listen in and not miss out on any keen details. “WHAT!? Stiex I can’t just leave you to go attempting to do that! That’s like running into a minefield! WORSE! You could get seriously hurt or worse maybe k-” “DDraig. Relax. I know what I am doing. They got no idea who they are fucking with now.” Stiex interrupted again making DDraig fall silent, staring at Stiex, having the expression of shock with fear mixed in, like he was looking at someone he yet knew that with him saying that though, was far different from what he may have expected, like he was looking at someone else, or something else, but yet, he looked down and nodded his head in understanding. “Just… Please be careful Stiex, we all really care about you… Would hurt to lose well- my best friend…” DDraig spoke, looking at Stiex with worry but understanding with it too, which Stiex only looked at, able to see a slight shift in expression gain a bit of a worried look to it, but yet still remained quite the same. </p>

<p>“I’ll try, DDraig. For now, I’ll go tell the rest, Don’t let the bastard get to you now, since you’re not the enemy.” Stiex explained, watching as he then turned to the portal, about to leave, but took a moment to look back at DDraig, who looked back, giving a small thumbs up gesture to show he understood with a small smile, which Stiex nodded in response, then turned then stepped through the portal, this unknown maroon demon now just yet gone with the portal closing behind him, leaving DDraig there watching him go, then sigh, all alone now in some sense despite there being creatures around. The three are yet left silent after seeing the moment before them, quite a lot to process such a thing, even for that conversation leaving nothing but more questions and maybe a few answers, which Sans spoke up, looking at the rest, “That was odd, honestly.” “Yeah, it was…” Brook responded, looking over to Sans then to Bendy, seeing Bendy study what was outside thinking but it was like he was seeing something else for a moment but then got focus, seeming to suddenly move away from the window and start to run out yelling “THERE’S THAT DAMN SKELETON!” Which caused the other two to quickly follow after Bendy, who threw open the door and yelled “THERE YOU ARE YOU RUNNING LITTLE-’ suddenly right when Bendy did, caused DDraig to have a startle scream, quickly making a big fire on there hands that stopped Bendy from tackling them which they nearly have, standing in front of the flames that were close to having hit him.</p>

<p>Bendy then backed up slowly while DDraig shaked in fear from it, making Brook and Sans quickly go to where Bendy is, then looked at DDraig, Brook speaking up while Sans brought Bendy further away, “Sorry! Sorry he didn’t mean to do that! He just was upset from earlier and-” “COME ON BROOK! HE LITERALLY PUT YOU IN DANGER DURING THAT CHASE THEY CLEARLY CAUSED EVEN THOSE CREATURES!” Bendy interrupted Brook, which Brook looked over, hearing it then back at DDraig, who lowered the flames but was still so scared for how they behaved and how the look on his face was, “I- I didn’t cause that! Did that really happen?? Are you all okay then!?? Why would they-” DDraig seemed to go silent, noticing something about Brook, which made him stay silent but the look on there face went more to fear, causing the three to look at one another in confusion but yet in a learning of things then to DDraig, who quickly looked up at them all, nervously sweating. “Oh no I see why now- oh no oh no- WAIT IF YOU HAVE ONE THEN- THAT MEANS- Oh no, oh no- WAIT WHY ARE YOU ALL EVEN HERE!?? I TOLD YOU NOT TO IT’S NOT SAFE! EVEN WITH THAT BIG COTS OUT HERE AND-” “HOW DO YOU KNOW IT’S CALLED THAT!??” Bendy interrupted, making DDraig more scared and yet seem worried, checking around constantly, which to think is interesting now how they don’t want the three to get hurt, and yet one thinks they’re the threat, but they don’t seem it. </p>

<p>“LOOK UH- IT’S A LOT TO EXPLAIN HERE I’M TELLING YOU THOUGH I DON’T MEAN ANYTHING BAD!” DDraig explained, which Bendy gave a look of suspicion, but waited to speak to see if more would be said, making DDraig get more panicky perhaps from the fear of danger to happen. Brook seemed to then look at Bendy, putting up there hand to gesture for Bendy to settle and not start doing that which Bendy seemed to understand for another chase could happen if so, as looked at DDraig smiling a gentle smile to reassure them things are okay, which settled DDraig down some more from it, then attempted to explain, “Look, I really- really don’t mean any harm, I’m trying to protect you all and the rest! Look there is someone bad causing this and far powerful being extremely dangerous for some of you that it would be death to go do so! Even then you could be caught by one the helpers here for this that can be just as bad even!” “And how do you know all this?? You a sp-” “Bendy, stop.” Sans interrupted Bendy who tried to figure out why DDraig knows all this even telling them all this, which DDraig grew a bit unsure of but tried to remain calm, must be a lot to think. “So- DDraig right? You seem to know quite a lot about this, even- well nevermind that actually, how do you know all this?” Brook asked which made DDraig think for a moment on what was asked, being quite the question to him that he was yet not suspecting. </p>

<p>“Uh- Well, I feel like uh- If I say your friend will try and attack and-” “We will handle him.” Sans interrupted DDraig, and Bendy gave a look to what Sans said and shouted “HEY!” to what was said which Sans only looked at them then away to focus on the situation at hand. “Well- Look the reason I know this uh- is because I was-” “Hold it right there Dragão Escuro!” A voice seemed then shout interrupting DDraig which DDraig recognized the voice able to see there face faded into a look of absolute fear shaking already from where he stood, looking at the rest and his tone shaky with fear and quiet like a mouse that said, “quick, leave” but had no luck for all three had their focus on who has yet shouted such a thing. It looked as though someone wearing a brown coat with a brown felt hat which the face was mostly hidden from the shade the hat gave and the black hair they had that was with there steel gray skin, as for other parts that weren’t so hidden due to it was there feet and some of there legs looking like they wore light yellow boots that looked clawed like the hands of a griffin and a long tail that had a bordeaux color looking like a dragons tail in some way for the white spine it had along the tail and a white pointy spade at the end of it. </p>

<p>Then they pointed right at to DDraig, seeming to refer to them seeing there hand looking quite clawed and skeleton like for how it was to guess an incident must’ve happened to cause such a thing, shouting once again this coat person, “Back away from these innocent people for they don’t need to deal with your greedy and trickster like doings!” which DDraig only looked more scared and has grown yet silent aside from the very quiet mumbling of there's that was mumbling something about trying to stay calm and think of what his friend said. “Wait he wasn’t-” Brook tried to speak but then there was a roar from behind her, looking over to see those COTS seem to start running over standing where DDraig was as if to try and frame him for it which DDraig was startled by trying to back away, looking back at them which Sans and Bendy looked as well then at the person who yet spoke, certainly causing a mix of emotions here on who to believe or not, which then Sans spoke up as if figuring the situation and what to do for it, though not having time to explain but yet spoke up, “Get the COTS” which got Brook and Bendys attention but they both nodded and Bendy quickly turned to one the COTS and charged at it right away, tackling it down while it tried to swipe at him, Sans then started going for the other one which Brook tried to follow but suddenly the person from before put there arm in front of them, stopping Brook for where she was, then turned there head to look at them, speaking up with a “No need to fight sweetheart, you wouldn’t want to get your pretty self dirty, now then, step aside while I will handle the issue with your friends.” Then the Person went on forward, which Brook only gave a look that had the feeling of being insulted but also weirded out by what she was called too. </p>

<h5>Behind You.</h5>

<p>That’s what echoed through her head again it felt, making her turn and notice a COTS try to grab her but she quickly jumped to the side kind of like how Sonic did she thought when they met, watching it turn and try to jump at them, dodging again but backed right into a tree, hitting it seeing the creature roar and start charging in for an attack making Brook thinking the worst trying to prepare to yet knows she’ll mess up the timing before noticed suddenly Bendy tackle the COTS right to the ground that roared in his face before they punched it that caused it to shut up and fade into the ground like a shadow fading away by the light shining right on it. Bendy then turned to look at Brook quickly, noticing something from above and rushes over which Brook was confused but looked up to see a COTS looking right back at her that one can figure was about to attack which before it had time to just got pulled aside right from Bendy watching it fall down, seeing it hit the snowy ground, panic a moment then flee, which made one realize it looked quite like the one that Brook saw before, but had no time to react being pulled again by Bendy to dodge a COTS that charged at them all in a quick movement as he spoke up “Be careful Brook! Sheesh you know these creatures can really hurt you!” “But what do I do though? I don’t have as much power as you both so-” Once Brook said that quickly noticed something pushing Bendy aside while moving to dodge an attack that Bendy followed Brook’s lead from that, looking at her again.  </p>

<p>“Well There has to be something! What are you good at??” “Art?? Look everything I tried each time we encountered them hasn’t worked I don’t know if-” Brook noticed one about to attack, quickly pulling Bendy over with them following dodging it as punched it in the face hitting it into a tree, looking over quickly to Brook, “Come on! I’m sure there is something Brook! Like- uh- weapon or something like-” While Bendy said that, Brook noticed an attack incoming, quickly she grabbed hold of Bendys arm to cause them to punch the COTS right into  the ground, causing it to vanish, which Bendy was surprised by but followed with, then looked at Brook who has let go of his arm, then spoke up again, “Well that works in some sense when you could’ve did that” “You got more strength then I do” Brook responded, sticking by Bendy who quickly noticed Sans fighting off quite a few and quickly rushes in to join, causing Brook to follow with so she won't have to fight alone and can help out. </p>

<p>Suddenly quickly was tackled to the side, hitting into the snow, looking to see it was DDraig where a COTS went flying by, then DDraig looked, getting up quickly and offered his hand, speaking right away a “Sorry! I saw you were gonna get hit and-” before was interrupted by the person wearing the coat, tackling DDraig down with quite the force. Brook quickly got up, moving away, about to go help, but yet was stopped by hearing a COTS roar out, about to charge at Brook but she quickly moved away again to behind a tree that was nearby to cause it to run right into the tree kind of like a toon, which can hear Bendy laugh as if watched that happen for when Brook did that before seeing him have to suddenly fight a COTS that went charging at him. This is all quite the battle, yet not as simple as one wished it to be, what are these creatures working for? Why are there so many? Wonders one must save for another time truly. <em>Stolen by one, created by another…</em></p>

<p>Soon, a fight after a fight for each one the COTS decreased and soon all began to flee or fade away like a light shone on them, causing everyone to be pretty tired out, except for what seems like the coated person that was there seeming then to cause DDraig to flee off to somewhere, giving a shoo gesture to him while this coat person watch, before turning to the tired out three, all taking a moment before this coat person spoke up. “I see you all have quite the fighting spirit to handle those creatures, interesting, you're quite different from what I was suspecting, even that gem you got there.” The coat person gestured to Brook for who he was referring to as a gem, which caused Bendy to give a confused look and Sans a look of suspicion of Brook to be called that while it caused Brook to hold onto the gem on her necklace. “She's not a rock?” “Bendy, that's not what they meant.” Sans answered Bendy’s question and was yet quite confused by the coat person's nickname of sorts. “Ah, I can tell right off the bat you all are from different universes, well except the one, Interesting. Well now, I am Balaur, I came here due to an enemy of mine fleeing here with these creatures and hence I made it my goal to defeat and stop him. Luckily for you guys he came right to you, perhaps because you're holding onto a jewel he would take, but no need to worry now, for I will protect you fellas and lead you right back to where you need to go for I am sure this issue will be over soon.” The coat person known as Balaur now spoke, explaining why they are here and what is going on, which everyone gave a look of slight confusion to but understanding, except for Brook she yet thought more otherwise about what was said, like it seems it isn’t the truth.</p>

<p>“Now then, I won’t hassle you folks into telling me your names, for there are universes in danger here, come along now, onward to stopping first the issue going on here.” Balaur spoke again, before turning and beginning to lead the way, can tell he was focused on this goal of handling this ‘evil’ person, which Bendy and Sans looked at him then to Brook, where Brook looked back, thinking then spoke up in a whisper tone, “Guys… I don’t think we should follow this guy…” “Brook, maybe they are onto something, look clearly the DDraig guy wants us to believe there innocent even if they talked to that weird edgy guy who could’ve actually been warning of about the good guys”! Bendy responded, which Sans gave a look of uncertainty hearing that, deciding to speak up of what he thought of it, “Bendy I’m not sure on that, could be all a trick for all we know, So here's a method here, how about we-” “Fellas! Fellas, come on, no need to chit chat now, sometimes things aren’t what they seem after all! Come on, I will explain now what’s up, how about that?” Balaur interrupted, going over to the rest with a calm smile on his face, looking at each one which all just looked at Balaur then at one another, before Balaur spoke again. </p>

<p>“Come on now, There’s a lot of talking to do, I will lead” till Balaur began to walk onward, the rest looking and taking a moment before looking at one another, taking a moment before Sans spoke up in a whisper saying “best to go along with it  huh?” which the other two just gave a kinda nod to, before the three all began to follow Balaur now, unsure what it is about.  Brook only following in silence, looking onward but yet was lost in thought, She isn’t sure on trusting this guy, especially when DDraig did just save her from an attack, especially with seeing someone from that portal step out and seem to talk about something, something bound to happen, four screams, by dusk of today… Who was that Stiex person for what DDraig called them, certainly she swore she sensed something from him but she isn’t sure what, oh she wish she knew. Till Bendy seemed to notice Brook being quite quiet, slowing down his walk to walk beside Brook, studying them and taking a moment to speak up “You okay?...” Brook seemed to then hear that, looking over to Bendy, then looking ahead before back at him, keeping her voice low now, “Yeah just… Hm, if I tell you this one thing, will you believe me?” Brook looked at Bendy who didn’t suspect that question, studying Brook hearing it, but then gave a small smile, showing he is listening before responding with a “Yeah, yeah I will.” which caused Brook to look at him then ahead, taking a moment to think of how to word such a thing. </p>

<p>“Bendy, The reason I’m not sure of this… person, is because DDraig had saved me from an attack I didn’t see coming… Which doesn’t make sense to happen if they’re considered this ‘evil’ thing despite him never attacking us, how come he did that?...” Brook asked in a low voice, making sure this Balaur guy didn’t hear but didn’t mind if Sans did hear, can guess he must be listening in just in silence like the few times he has before. Bendy yet listened, studying Brook for a moment hearing that, till just gave a small smile to reassure Brook showing he understands and if that wasn’t clear enough he spoke up with a low voice as well saying “I believe you Brook, Though it does really bring a wonder to that, who knows now if this guy is either good or bad then if anything, I surely can’t tell for what they’re wearing, really hides their face even with that hat of his, but he shouldn’t mean any harm, right?” Bendy then asked, Brook looked at Bendy then to Balaur, thinking of it, studying them in silence. “Who knows Bendy, who really knows, but thank you for believing me, even helping me earlier to add.” “Your welcome Brook!” Bendy responded to what Brook had said, causing Brook to look at Bendy with a smile then ahead again which Bendy did as well, though stayed walking right by her so Brook won’t have to walk along in any way. Though it surely is odd, very odd to her about this whole person they are dealing with now, even a wonder who's of greater power, who's causing this all, so much more.</p>

<h5>How… funny.</h5>

<p>Is what echoed through her head, causing her to shake a little from it, but yet a cold breeze yet hit her side to bring her back to reality of what is going on, taking a moment to focus properly, causing her to quietly move closer to Bendy and continue to walk.</p>

<h5>It’s a wonder  if you managed to scare a few, </h5>
<h5>Maybe you can scare some without knowing who they are</h5>
<h5>Which can be entertaining even more if you know who you're really scaring.</h5>

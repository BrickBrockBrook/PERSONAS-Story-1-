<h2>Chapter 23. Rescue Mission</h2>

<hr class="new2">

<p>The air, was somewhat cold, for what can be felt the ground was solid same with the walls, but what can also be felt nearby was what seemed to be someone but it’s hard to tell with having one's eyes closed, which slowly opening them can notice it was a COTS, but it was that strange one from the first universe with that scarf almost and odd ear like horns again, but it didn’t attack, just looked to them, then looked around which can notice Bendy and Mugman were okay they just seemed to still be knocked out a bit from falling into this place, as for Sans and Baldi who knows where they are now. “W…Who…” Brook began to speak up to try to talk to this odd COTS but the COTS was suddenly startled, looking to Brook before quickly leaving now, jumping over a COTS that was fading away and that odd COTS was then gone. To guess maybe the COTS helped them? It didn’t try to attack them so… But back to focusing, Brook now got up and went over to check Mugman and Bendy, they aren’t hurt too bad it seems, sure Mugman got a few small extra cracks on his handle but he’s okay as for Bendy he just seems bruised up a bit, but they got through. Brook studied the area till then seeing the walls were these white bricks and the floor was an odd buttermilk color in a way, to think it looks similar to what a school would look like. Till Can then hear Bendy was now waking up, making Brook turn her attention to him now so she can be sure he was okay. “Ow.. My head…” Bendy spoke up, slowly sitting up and checking a bit around while holding the side of his head. </p>

<p>“You alright?” Brook asked which seemed to startle Bendy who quickly readied to attack, paused, realized it was Brook then smiled lowering his hand and sighed in relief knowing it was just Brook. “Thank goodness it’s just you! Yeah I am doing good just hit my head a bit, Where are we now? Hell! Where is the COTS that got us stuck here??” Bendy asked which Brook had a somewhat guess of an answer but couldn’t answer since both Brook and Bendy heard Mugman beginning to wake up now too. Brook and Bendy went over to check Mugman now who slowly awakened and looked to the two who were nearby and gave a confused look on to the surroundings next. “Ow… W-Where are we?” Mugman asked which Brook and Bendy exchanged looks then looked back to Mugman now. “Well, Not in your universe clearly!” Bendy answered which Mugman began to slowly sit up though put his hand near where his handle was, seeming it hurt a bit from when they winded up here. “Oh… Wait, Sans and Baldi, Are they okay? Do we know if they’re here??” Mugman asked, looking a bit around now worried for Sans and Baldi and if they’re okay. “We got no idea on that, they should be okay though since they are smart and strong so they should be okay right now.” Brook answered to reassure Mugman who listened and gave a small smile hearing it as he got up now. “Well by the sounds of it guess we got to start searching! So, Who remembers what the inside of that portal looked like for the universe they could’ve fallen into?” Bendy asked, looking to Mugman and Brook to get started on trying to figure where Baldi and Sans could’ve winded up. </p>

<p>Brook and Mugman looked to each other to try and remember, but nothing came to mind, it was all so sudden in the moment it’s hard to remember anything for it, which Bendy was able to tell that clearly none of them had any clues due to this. “Well. Guess we are exploring till then! Maybe they could’ve winded up here so it could be worth asking around! Or at least someone came from a portal that could’ve been where they winded up!” Bendy then gave an idea of what to do which Brook and Mugman nodded, which Bendy smiled before looking to Brook to lead the way this time, which Brook understood and began to lead the way. The three walked on and explored the place around, seeing the halls were like a maze it felt going to all sorts of different places and even coming across some blue doors that checking in were rooms with a desk at the front and small tables with chairs faced to look at the one table that had a chalkboard on the wall along with it which confirmed that this place was some form of a school because of it, but yet what isn’t helping is how a lot of rooms looked the exact same aside from a small change due to it making it hard to figure where they are, which made Brook a little confused where they’re going same with Mugman who keeps trying to guess if they have or haven’t been down some of these halls which Bendy was following and seeing how this was getting to be a struggle, it wasn’t until when getting to one the halls Bendy decided to speak up. “Okay am I the only one here who’s getting the idea on where we’re going??” Bendy asked which Brook and Mugman looked at him upon hearing it. “You’re not lost?” Brook asked which Mugman then added “This place feels like a maze though!” to agree with Brook in a way of being confused how Bendy gets the idea of where they’re going. </p>

<p>“Well yeah I’m not lost! This is nothing compared to where I came from! Come on! We haven’t been down this hallway yet!” Bendy spoke up, quickly beginning to lead a bit now to show which hallways they have and haven’t gone down to try and find more so where they are, but what’s odd is how this place isn’t too populated, maybe at different parts it might be, but oddly right now there is a lack of COTS surprisingly, but it makes it easy for them to adjust to their surroundings and be sure they’re all okay from any injuries as well. As they walked it was time to might as well have some conversation which Mugman was quick in getting started in doing so. “So Bendy? How are you able to keep track of where you’re going?” Mugman asked Bendy who was leading which Bendy smiled hearing it. “Well simple! You keep track of where you started then you make a map in your head from there, like a blank paper and just pencil lines telling you where you’ve gone or are going to! It’s actually quite fun to imagine” Bendy explained, to which Mugman seemed fascinated by the idea that Brook was as well upon hearing it, that is an inventive trick to have really. </p>

<p>“Woah! How do you know these tricks and all of this other stuff? It’s so cool and helpful even for this journey we’re on!” Mugman asked another question which Bendy listened to, having an answer ready. “Well! I learned them from someone important to me, taught me everything I needed to know and now I am capable of doing so much because of him! Hehe, makes me remember how much we felt related in some way.” Bendy answered but then looked away once saying about that part, which Mugman was a little confused but Brook got it a bit due to Bendy mentioning this person a bit before to her, someone that felt like family to him, which leaves Brook wondering a bit on more about this person especially when before Bendy even said when upset at the one universe they went elsewhere and he wanted to follow but is that too much to ask? Maybe. “Hey, that reminds me, Bendy you briefly said it before and I don’t know if it's too much to ask you don’t have to answer but… For this person that felt like family, what did you mean when you said this person left the universe you’re from? Couldn’t they take you with them?” Brook asked, which can notice that Bendys smile kinda faded hearing it as he looked on ahead but a bit at both Mugman and Brook to show he will still answer. </p>

<p>“...No, I asked if I could go with but… The way it was made it impossible for me to go wherever there universe is. But, they helped me figure hopefully a way to get to them and now? With this going on maybe I will find them! Right?” Bendy did at the end try to keep it positive as he looked at Mugman and Brook in hopes for some positivity from them too which both were ready to provide. “Absolutely! It’s clear you’re both searching for one another and will find one another at some point!” Mugman exclaimed which Brook then added to it “Even if there are so many universes I’m sure despite it you’d find one another somehow” which once both Mugman and Brook said that it got Bendy to smile again. “Thanks guys, you know I think we all are friends at this point!” Bendy smiled and added that little bit which to notice when Mugman heard it he clearly got excited. “We are??? YAY! Friends on a journey to help save everyone from everywhere!” Mugman exclaimed with excitement which got Brook and Bendy laughing at hearing it as they journeyed onward through this place, hopefully they do find something or someone around here, that way they can have a better chance at finding the rest or even just finding some sort of clue if there may even be other helpers of this madness here. Soon enough the three walked on till Bendy was quick to stop Brook and Mugman seeing ahead there was a large crowd of COTS swarming around and wrecking havoc by breaking walls, attacking each other, tearing up the floor, breaking the lights, just absolute havoc. “Alright, looks like we got some COTS to deal with! Are you guys ready??” Bendy asked Mugman and Brook as he prepared himself to be ready to fight which Mugman quickly began to charge up an attack readying to shoot with a ready smile as Brook quietly figured out some way to get ready as well for this. </p>

<p>Once It was clear they were all ready, Mugman quickly shot first hitting a lot of the COTS as Bendy charged in to start attacking right after the shot has been sent out which Brook quickly picked up Mugman to help Mugman charge in faster with which gave Mugman a chance to be on a higher ground to being able to shoot at each of the COTS due to it. The COTS were quick at attacking back managing to knock Bendy around while attacking though Bendy found a way out from it quickly to handle them, while each COTS that came towards Brook and Mugman, Mugman quickly dealt with to keep away as if they got a little to close Brook would kick them back so Mugman can finish them off too. Till can notice during it Bendy was struggling a lot more since more COTS kept coming and surrounding Bendy, which Brook and Mugman quickly went over to help him out, Mugman hoping off Brook which Mugman put his hand out to Brook which Brook understood, giving a high five as Mugman quickly bounced up to shoot out that magic attack again which Brook caught him to aim the blast at all the other COTS around to be sure it won’t hit Bendy which Bendy saw and rooted once seeing it. Once Mugman finished, Brook quickly placed Mugman down again as Bendy was handling the other COTS who weren’t hit by it that Mugman began to help out with quickly. </p>

<p>Suddenly a COTS quickly grabbed Brook from behind tossing her away and into a wall, then more COTS began to surround to go after her which Brook quickly tried to use her hood to block some the COTS from going after her which helped a little but most still tried to scratch at her and bite which some got a few hits on her. Which as Brook tried suddenly just a faint dark smoke came around from underneath for what Brook can see before suddenly hearing a lot of the COTS suddenly drop down onto the ground, which Brook looked as the smoke quickly trailed away like it was fleeing the scene, that was weird, which Bendy and Mugman finished up what they had, watching the smoke dash by and away as they looked to Brook now just as confused as she was. Before questions can be asked a COTS dashed by them going extremely fast, the three managing to dodge it before it could hit any of them, then seeing it hit into the wall, turn around to aim at them again, which then can notice more COTS were coming around perhaps to ready to attack as well, this isn’t looking to good. Quickly this fast COTS charged down to go at them as then all the other COTS came dashing in, which quickly Bendy brought Mugman and Brook over to him before quickly melting into the ground pulling them down with him to dodge the attacks quickly. </p>

<p>For what can be heard as they hid was the COTS bashing into one another and attacking each other which surely means they dodged that, which looking a bit around this darkness that this brings when like this can suddenly see a hand reach down which startled everyone quickly feeling Bendy pull them along to quickly go up and out from there a bit further away from the crowd though it seems a lot the COTS noticed them, which due to it Bendy quickly got ready to fight now. “WE CAN TAKE THEM!” Bendy shouted ready to fight before Brook quickly pulled him back by his arm as Mugman was worried about this idea just like how Brook was. “Bendy there are too many! We can’t take them all at once! Come on!” Brook spoke with concern in her voice which Bendy looked to Brook then listened before quickly having to dodge a COTS dashing by which gave them the sign to start to quickly run now away from this crowd of COTS. The three ran fast, following Bendy who kept turning from each corner to corner since he knew where they were going as Mugman and Brook followed with till they reach an end to one the halls with no other turns around, which Bendy was quickly going through the walls to check for another way then looked to the other two now being tired out as he did that. “CRAP! I’m not seeing another way around here guys!” Bendy spoke up while Mugman and Brook looked worried due to this as they looked for maybe a chance to turn back, the crowd of COTS were already there, this isn’t looking so good now. </p>

<p>Quickly Mugman began to charge up for a magic attack in case as Bendy quickly stepped to the front to protect them both readying to fight, though Brook as she would’ve gotten ready wasn’t sure of this, no matter what something is going to go wrong and then they’d be in danger, there has to be another way, they won’t be as lucky as last time after all. Then can hear a loud whistle from somewhere behind the COTS, which seemed the COTS paused to look which confused the three from that, before then seeing quickly each COTS began being attacked by a fast spinning blue ball hitting into each one at incredible speeds before quickly seeing then the ball form out seeing it was- Sonic! Although Mugman and Bendy were confused who this was, Brook knew and was happy to see him handle each of the COTS at fast speeds before landing in front of the three dusting their hands off once that was all done. “All done! And look at the luck of this!” Sonic spoke up giving a smile to them all but looked at Brook mostly since can tell he remembered Brook. “Sonic! You’re okay! Thank goodness for that!” Brook spoke up, smiling at Sonic which once Mugman and Bendy saw how Brook knew Sonic they all adjusted and knew there was no danger now. “Well nobody can take me down that easily! Now who are these two who are with you anyway?” Sonic asked, pointing out Mugman and Bendy giving the two a curious smile. </p>

<p>“Well these two are Mugman and Bendy, there is two others but we kinda lost them and are trying to find them, they are helping out to stop all that’s going on right now and so far we got some idea on what’s going on” Brook explained which Mugman and Bendy gave Sonic a wave which Sonic gave a wave back to the two once he saw them wave. “Well nice to meet you both!” Sonic proudly spoke, going over to the two to introduce himself properly to them. “Well nice to meet you as well Sonic, you seem like a not so bad guy!” Bendy spoke up, giving a smile to Sonic which Sonic was proud to hear him say that. “You were so cool fighting those COTS!” Mugman spoke in awe at Sonic, able to tell they found Sonic to be cool which Sonic laughed a little hearing. “Well thanks! It ain’t my first time after all dealing with a bunch of bad guys!” Sonic answered Mugman a bit which made Mugman seem more in awe hearing that and getting excited too. “Well it’s going to be great having you on the team Sonic I can tell!” Bendy added, which Sonic looked at Bendy now and seemed to think for a second seeing he was studying Bendy before then having a smile and a look that had a question. “Hey you kind of remind me of someone I saw in one of the universes! They said all sorts even about someone like you for what it seems! That means I know you're going to be great to be around!” </p>

<p>Sonic didn’t really ask a question but did seem intrigued by it which Bendy was really curious what Sonic meant by that but before anything can be asked, can hear a loud crashing sound from further away but loud enough to bring some curiosity, looks like they all got to get back to checking what’s going on. “Alright, looks like talking will have to wait guys, maybe that's a sign of perhaps more of those bad people!” Brook spoke up which the rest agreed with her before quickly all began to head towards that direction, Sonic quickly moving ahead of the rest to see what’s going on first and be ready to take care of any COTS crowds which ensured the rest that they are going to be ready if so. Which can hear more crashes from further ahead and when reaching can see a brute COTS bashing one the COTS into a wall seeing a crowd of them which looked to them all, even seeing some that looked new to the group suddenly dash over at high speeds though Sonic was fast to take care of them due to them being faster then these COTS that were charging, which yet quickly Bendy charged in right after to target some the COTS as Mugman got a boost up from Brook to shoot at the group of COTS. Sonic saw this and got excited now charging in to in a ball formation that dashed in after spinning in place, hitting multiple COTS at a fast speed which helped Bendy out deal with some of the ones he couldn’t get and were getting in the way giving Bendy openings to strike more the COTS. </p>

<p>Mugman was quickly shooting which yet also allowed for Sonic to get openings due to the COTS trying to get to where Mugman is but Brook helped make sure the COTS stayed far back by stepping back  further or even hitting them back in some way the best she could which at least worked which got the rest to handle any of the COTS before it could try to attempt to get more closer, till soon all the COTS were all handled with as everyone was tired out but yet they have succeeded. Which was a relief and a surprise how they all managed to deal with all those COTS even when brute ones were in the mix same with fast ones as well, guess they all are getting stronger. “Now that was a piece of cake!” Bendy exclaimed which Sonic cheered a little to agree with it. “If it was that easy then wouldn’t it mean though then that something worse is lurking around this place? Maybe more of those bad guys are here?” Brook questioned and showed concern about this, sure it’s a nice change of pace for it is easier but what if something worse is around? They wouldn’t make it this easy for this universe after all, right? It wouldn’t make sense if so. Just as Brook said that can hear another crash from somewhere that was close by but not from anywhere the four can see, causing Sonic to quickly dash around to check then paused looking down one the hallways, able to tell he was looking at something, or maybe someone which told the rest to come over and check out what’s going on as well. </p>

<p>The rest quickly went over to see what Sonic saw and yet can see in the hall someone else was there, just one person who paused seeming they were looking right back at them all, it looked as though it was someone who looked similar to Sonic except they were a light salmon pink color instead of blue, having not the pointed spikes Sonic had but more curved ones, seeing they had black on the cuffs of the gloves and horns that curled before little points stuck out from them and the shoes were similar but had a black, yellow and white color scheme instead, there eyes one was more gray and the other black and lastly the main difference is there one arm was cut off from what seems like a while ago not having a hand there and appeared beat up, which left wonders on what happened to them, but it’s best to not ask. Though as Sonic was about to speak up once the rest saw, can see how they panicked for a second and suddenly felt like there was a wave of pain hitting into the four, feeling like a lot of spots hurt especially in the one arm for the amount of pain that is there like half of it was numb but throbbed but the rest stung and tingle in ways that hurt, even in the head it stings badly like a bad headache, which clearly was hard for everyone dealing with it, something had to be done and to guess for how the pain feels its similar to the person before them who was standing there shaking. </p>

<p>Luckily Brook managed to find some strength to speak up as the rest struggled with this. “W-Woah it’s okay, w-we won’t hurt you! Y-you don’t have to do this- o-okay?” Brook spoke up while trying to handle the pain but it was surely difficult even for standing, but luckily Bendy was nearby and found a way to keep Brook up so she could talk and not risk falling when trying. Can see this person pause, shaking and worried but studied the group before feeling that the pain was quickly gone and away from the four which allowed them all to take a moment and feel they need to breathe after that. “Thank you…” Brook spoke up once again looking at this person who was standing further away now but was watching everyone to see what they’ll do, though yet the four were just taking a moment before being able to properly look at this person. “Okay now tha-” Sonic was about to question and say that wasn’t cool but Bendy quickly covered Sonic's mouth, it probably wouldn’t be a good idea unless they all want to be stuck feeling pain again. Which allowed Mugman to try to be the one to speak now to help figure what is going on in this situation. “We are so sorry to have bothered you!.. We are just looking for our friends, have you seen a skeleton and a human in a green sweater anywhere?” Mugman asked, having a tone of concern but care which can tell the person was trying to process it. “No… Only a jester but… You didn’t say anything on a jester.” The person quietly spoke up to answer it which left the rest to look to one another, there is that at least for an answer but, not exactly the one they wanted to hear, unless maybe that jester knows if the other two are around here. </p>

<p>“Thank you uh… What was your name?” Brook thanked the person but also got curious to what their name is, which the person froze not expecting the question or perhaps even a thank you but then gave an answer soon enough. “Nuqx…” The person now known as Nuqx answered with hesitance, making the rest happy to hear they got an answer who this is, maybe they are connected to some of the things going on to think, but then again, there aren't really any signs. “Nuqx, thank you for telling us what you can, but you’re aware it’s not safe to be walking around here right? Sure what you did before is powerful but these creatures may not take too kindly to it…” Brook tried to explain to Nuqx that it’s not exactly safe out here for she isn’t sure how the COTS take exactly to just feeling pain since a lot of them just attack until they vanish into nothing like a shadow vanishing due to the light so it’s mostly guessing this is the case which hopefully helps them, maybe that's why they’re so hurt after all. “Brook is right here! And there are a few spaces you can go to if that helps just further ahead in some of the rooms, a lot of the rooms I found should have a spot you can be safe in.” Bendy added to help Brook out which Nuqx just watched the four listening in to what was said, which leaves hopes they are listening and taking this advice. </p>

<p>“...I’m sorry.” Nuqx quietly spoke up with a mumble, leaving the four confused. “What- Can you say that again buddy? Don’t think I quite heard yeah right.” Sonic was quick to ask again what Nuqx had said, which Nuqx looked to the four but more so past them having an expression that showed regret. “I’m sorry.” Nuqx spoke up louder now, seeing Nuqx watch the four or more so whatever is past them. The four became more confused on what he meant, maybe it was for earlier? But before guesses could be made suddenly quickly noticed something smash into Bendy hitting him into the wall then quickly charged at Sonic but Sonic was fast to dodge though hit Mugman into the wall instead, seeing this was a person doing this who wore a mask that looked devil like, having long blond hair with hands and feet that floated having no arms or legs with, which before more can be studied quickly Sonic moved Brook aside to dodge another charge from this person who had a club in hand trying to attack them. “WOAH HEY! WATCH IT!” Sonic shouted before this person quickly hit Sonic into the wall now, then aimed to charge at Brook but quickly Bendy popped out from the ground and hit the person away right into the wall now this time. </p>

<p>“ALRIGHT WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA HERE!??” Bendy shouted, upset by this clearly since this person hurt some the rest a little and clearly something was up if so if they got tricked like this to thinking its safe. “YOU IN WAY! WE DEFEAT YOU!” The person shouted, suddenly quickly charging again but Bendy quickly held them back the best he can so the rest won’t be hurt more. “WE?? YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE ATTACKING!” Bendy shouted back at this person which Brook then felt a tug from Mugman gesturing to Nuqx who seemed to ready to step forward though appeared to not be proud about it, which quickly Brook looked to Sonic giving a look that said it all which Sonic quickly dashed in to pull Bendy away from this person before the wave of pain could hit anyone and instead got this person who struggled a little feeling it all. But then can see they quickly reached behind the mask somewhere pressing a button seeing they now weren’t feeling pain as they readied their weapon again, great another one with tricks but then they quickly began to charge at them, Which got Sonic to quickly help everyone move again to dodge. “STOP DODGING!” The person yelled looking at them all now trying to figure out why they are, then looked to Nuqx moving there hand to tell Nuqx to stop using their powers, seeing them step back and watch. “You keep trying to hurt us!” Mugman exclaimed, “YEAH! YOU KEEP ATTACKING US! WHO EVEN ARE YOU ANYWAY?” Bendy supported Mugman now asking who even is this person, maybe they can get some answers somehow. </p>

<p>“YOU ARE ENEMIES TO OUR TEAM! THUS I! CLUBTACKA! WILL BASH YOU!” The person now known as Clubtacka shouted, raising their club as they did, before then swinging it down to point at them all. “ENOUGH TALK NOW! OFF WITH YOUR HEADS!” Clubtacka added, before then charging in making it clear the four are in for quite a fight now with this.</p>

<h5>You hit me first, I go down</h5>
<h5>You hit me last, I go first</h5>
<h5>I hit you, you become the one who stays down</h5>
<h5>In this race, we see who stays down for good. </h5>

<h2>Chapter 20. Mysteries Upon Mysteries</h2>

<p>“Who the hell are you?” Stiex was straightforward right off the bat, glaring at Bendy which Bendy looked back and surely he wasn’t comfortable with that glare right away. “Just someone who is helping you out since you nearly got attacked just now?” Bendy sounded confused but he wasn’t clearly he just wasn’t sure how to answer questions coming from Stiex, at least everybody can tell that’s for sure, though it seems Stiex was able to tell as well it seems for how quick he had a response to this. “Alright. Then why are you still standing here now that you’ve done what you so desired to do?” Stiex still glared at Bendy which Bendy glanced a bit at the rest in hopes for some ideas how to deal with this, which yet Mugman quickly came over now not afraid of this and just willing to help out which yet probably may worsen this situation. “We’re just making sure you’re okay! It is dangerous out here after all and we want to be sure everyone in every universe is going to be okay!” Mugman was quick to speak up and smiled doing so while Bendy smiled upon seeing Mugman do so. “Exactly! Besides, everyone matters and we don’t want them to fall into some evil hands of some people that are lurking around in some universes!” Bendy added on as he looked to Stiex which Stiex was listening and caught onto everything far too quickly. </p>

<p>“You’re a real positive group.” That’s all Stiex said which seems he can tell there is more which yet meant Sans, Baldi and Brook had to come out from hiding if so then, right? Which yet can see Stiex then looked over straight to where they are which confirms how he knows, so Sans began to exit out first now, then Baldi and Brook followed behind carefully standing mostly behind Mugman and Bendy who are mostly the two confronting Stiex more then them which Stiex seemed unsurprised by this. “Well we aren’t lying! We are all trying to do something here!” Bendy quickly wanted it to be clear they mean no harm, they are trying to do the right thing but yet Stiex seemed to have different plans for how quick he was to change the topic. “Mhm. Well, good luck.” Stiex then was walking away after having said that which everyone was confused about but yet Bendy looked to everyone then Stiex who was just about to go in a blink but Bendy realized how much info they could get it seems and tried to keep him here. “WAIT! STIEX WAIT! WE ACTUALLY GOT SOME QUESTIONS!” Bendy shouted which made Stiex pause, then look at him with a glare, one that surely gave a look asking back questions about how they knew his name, surely unnerving to see. “Uhhhh… Well…” “Do you know anyone in this evil group that could be causing chaos?” Sans gave a question for Bendy which works but yet Stiex looked as though he didn’t want to answer questions. </p>

<p>“Why the fuck does that matter to you?” Stiex did sound annoyed but who knows if he was going to do anything by chance. “So we can stop the bad guys!” Mugman spoke up with a smile even though he does seem a bit scared by Stiex he isn’t just judging him and is still yet trying to be friendly towards him which is nice to see. “...Don’t waste your time trying to figure them out or stop them. They’ll stop eventually.” Stiex gave a confusing answer, but if they stop it would mean they would have succeeded then? Which Bendy didn’t like being told to not do anything about this. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN??? WE GOT TO STOP THEM SINCE THEY CLEARLY ALL WON’T STOP TILL THERE BOSS STORSI OR WHATEVER THE NAME IS- IS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS!” Bendy shouted at Stiex who only listened but had more of a slight glare, he was not phased at all by this yelling and shouting which is surprising versus when Bendy did react like this before did make that Uvilein guy quiet down. “You done?” Is all Stiex said just glaring at Bendy while ignoring everyone else, which Bendy stared back giving a bit of a glare too but not as much perhaps because he was confused about if Stiex had anything to say as well, which he quietly nodded to answer Stiex’s question which yet Stiex looked at him and then turned around to walk away. “Alright. Then keep playing heroes and doing random shit.” “WHAT!?? YOU THINK WE ARE PLAYING???” Bendy shouted at Stiex who made that comment which of course stopped him from leaving which Sans now decided to step in to let Bendy settle down from all this shouting he’s doing. “Okay, Okay. Let’s just ask a different question, you don’t have to answer these. But do you know anyone by the names of Balaur, Uvilein and Luradis?” Sans asked which Stiex only looked at him, but Stiex wasn’t afraid to give some form of an answer. “Potentially. Why does that matter to you?” Stiex looked back, potentially is at least a good enough answer for this situation, it means he must know right? He has to. “What about the name Storsi for what Bendy said earlier, know anything about who that is?” Sans asked which Stiex stared back, giving a quick answer again. “Whatever the hell you said before about who that is should be a good enough answer for you. Now are you done? I got shit to do.” Stiex turned away and began to leave, which Bendy was ready to shout to stop him but Sans stopped Bendy, maybe they won’t get much answers from him after all, unless… “Do you know anyone by the names Alovo and DDraig?” Brook spoke up which yet Stiex stopped once again, it’s hard to tell if he was annoyed or not. </p>

<p>Though everyone did look to Brook wondering if that was a good question or not or the safest option, though once Stiex looked over it was quick to give chills surely. “So you were the ones watching.” Stiex spoke up giving a slight glare which as that could’ve been a question it seems more he knows the answer already, which yet gave some more chills. Can see Stiex then seem to attempt to walk towards which yet right when trying Bendy got in front of everyone to mostly guard everyone else and everyone else was a bit defensive as well mostly because it’s unsure what is planned for him to do, but he just seems unphased. “So, if you’ve watched during those times then tell me this. Why do you still plan to try and do something about this if you already know how it should be stopped?” Stiex questioned everyone, which as they probably would’ve known but-during those times they often missed parts of information sadly. Nobody could really give an answer to this yet Stiex waited for which Mugman wanted to try and say something since he wanted to keep it friendly and answer for everyone but he couldn’t and looked apologetic at Stiex. Which Stiex only looked at then stepped back, which he began to walk off again. “Guess you just won’t stop. Well, keep doing whatever.” Stiex began to leave but stopped then looked back like he suspected there to be another question, which yet there at least was one Brook had but- who knows if it’s just putting more danger here. </p>

<p>“...Do you know Solgo by chance? Since a bit further back they do kind of need some assistance…” Brook spoke up a little which yet Stiex looked at Brook, then past the group and just left without a word suddenly just gone from where he stood leaving maroon particles behind, checking around he surely was just gone in seconds, which once it was for sure everyone let out a sigh of relief since that surely was a stressful moment there. “Okay… Now that he’s gone, who was that and why do you guys seem to know him?” Baldi spoke up, he was silent during the whole thing which is fair since he’s never seen Stiex till now after all, so it surely does seem to require some explaining. “Well basically it’s this guy who we saw has been talking to some people that are in a similar situation Solgo has going on, yet it’s unknown if he is really good or bad or what he plans since it seems he is but uh-” “We haven’t been able to figure that out yet. Which I can blame you for getting us into this situation Bendy” Sans added to what Bendy had explained which yet once that last bit was said Bendy was confused but thought for a moment and realized it kind of was his fault this interaction happened. “Well I think he is good! Remember how he has to fight those COTS? That means they must be against him in some way! Maybe he just has some sort of way of being close with everyone that's in this bad organization?” </p>

<p>Mugman added which was really a thought to consider for this, which got Baldi to understand this whole thing a lot better upon hearing about this stuff. Brook listened in and yet to think it’s confusing why he’s so involved, but yet she knows Stiex shouldn’t have any dangerous intentions, after all when they got here he saved her, yet the only person who should remember this is Bendy since she told him but wasn’t brought up to the rest yet, it has to be said eventually so maybe more answers could be figured. As Brook was going to speak up can hear a loud crashing sound from where they planned to head, right, they have to deal with that whole thing still. “Alright, let’s focus on the task and handle this person, maybe they can tell us more about this whole situation.” Sans spoke up which everyone agreed with beginning to go onwards into the third area and upon entering can see just what looks like a lot of fighting going on seeing COTS attacking at people who appear cartoony and yet powerful to which it was hard to tell who was winning for some of the COTS were but also some of the cartoony people were against some of them too, which Mugman looked worried seeing such a sight like this one for it does seem he happens to know these people but yet looked determined to help despite it, which yet can then see Bendy charge into the chaos seeing a few COTS on the ground and attacked them to help a bit, which yet Mugman then followed suit to help out which caused everyone else to do so as well. </p>

<p>Seeing Sans blast at some COTS further away to help handle the ones that are being a nuisance to some of the cartoony people that are fighting while can see Baldi help out Mugman with some of them which yet at times can see Baldi just hit some that got to close away quickly if they’re a bother. While can see Bendy charging in each time to the closest ones and getting them which he made sure none got close to Brook doing so as Brook tried her best to help out a little by giving any warnings she could if there were any dangers she could notice trying to charge over or anything like that. Surely though the more they fought the more came it surely seems but everyone kept trying, which leaded to Brook having to warn more each time due to how much kept coming unsuspectedly on everyone, though it leaded to a point it’s hard to make sure she was safe too but can tell Bendy kept being very protective to make sure she was okay and along with everyone else whenever he went by them but one of those times was just a bad timing. While can see Bendy fighting a larger thing off with the rest the group, Brook kept watch during then the group having their hands full which made it more urgent to be sure they are safe, till there was a low growl behind her which as she turned can see a large brute like COTS aim to attack her which she didn’t have time to react or move. </p>

<p>Though nothing happened, looking again can see somehow the COTS was again and yet checking around just can see from a portal the COTS being pulled up into it by some sort of strings that's hard to make out what color, how weird but at least she didn’t get hurt in some way. Which then can feel quickly being pulled aside to dodge a COTS that came charging towards which Sans did so then looked to Brook now. “You're usually figuring out some solution to when things get too complex. Any ideas on how we can find that Luradis person?” Sans asked which Brook was thinking as she studied the area for any clues for where they could have gone. During it can notice Sans throwing bones at any COTS that got close waiting for an answer of some kind which as he threw some in a direction it was noticeable how there was more COTS in one direction, almost like it’s meant to obscure the way to it but for how many strong like ones there was along there it seems like it would be too difficult to get by in some way, which she gestured a bit so Sans can see the idea of where she thinks which Sans seemed to think Luradis could be that way to judging by the thinking expression he had, then he looked to the rest who were still trying to help most of everyone else then to Brook, it’s clear an idea needs to be figured and quickly before more COTS start coming around. </p>

<p>Brook thought for a second for a few ideas which one was perhaps they can sneak by but it seems to tough for any tricks they know, or to have a distraction to lure them all way perhaps but that’s risky as well, they could try to fight through but it can risk more dangers as well with that and one idea that she isn’t sure would work and may have to be a last resort is to see if perhaps they could find Stiex since they should be at where Solgo is right and if he could handle one of them with ease he has to be able to handle the rest but how is that even going to be possible to convince him to do when they all only just really talked to the guy face to face. Suddenly can see a large brute like COTS charging towards which Sans tried to blast it but it was brute forcing through it which yet made Sans quickly get Brook aside so it misses them both which yet the rest the group dodged to moving to where everyone else was soon seeing more come around nearby targeting on them practically surrounding the group now. “We’re surrounded..” Mugman spoke up worriedly to the rest which made it clear from all sides of the group there was no way out and who knows if they can fight a crowd this big, making it more of a hope anyone can think of something to do. </p>

<p>Brook sure as hell tried and tried but was surely having no clue what could since all of them were to complex and difficult in this case while Mugmans creative ideas couldn’t work for logical reasoning and Baldis clever ones just aren’t good enough to work at that and Sans couldn’t figure a way to make either work, which yet Brook looked to Bendy for some hope since it’s clear he was thinking of something and when he looked back, can tell he had an idea in seconds. Can see Bendy then reach for his back and can hear a goopy tear almost like sound seeing him hold up some of that inky goop and then can tell he quickly shaped it into something that appears explosive it just needs to be lit, which he looked at Mugman quickly. “Mugman, when I throw this you are going to shoot at the top part of it, okay?” Bendy asked in some way which Mugman nodded his head as Bendy then threw it into the crowd but before it went in can see Mugman shoot it seeing it light the explosive, then Bendy pulled everyone further back in some way before… an large explosion happened, launching a lot of the COTS on that end as it made the rest of the COTS scatter in panic upon seeing which yet can see Bendy reach for his back taking more of that inky goop and making another, aiming it towards them again which once saw a few try to charge towards he threw it in, Mugman shot at it again before it went into the other part of the crowd and yet another explosion. Causing a lot of the COTS that surrounded to scatter or fade away for the ones it hit, which was a majority, that yet everyone looked to Bendy now afterwards upon that happening, which he looked like he was tired while in pain but proud it worked. </p>

<p>“Works like always that trick!” Bendy spoke up while everyone still looked at him confused and surprised. “Are you…hurt?” Brook asked, she knows it must’ve and especially it being from his back it shouldn’t feel that nice for it being where he has some source of that healing power there.  “Only a little but hey you should know it’s going to be all good as new don’t worry!” Bendy responded which nobody understood aside from Brook, guess he still hasn’t said to the rest yet about that part. “Why haven’t you done anything like that before?” Sans asked which yet Bendy looked back which he seemed to think on it but yet had an answer that was logical for this. “Not the safest to do usually that’s why” Bendy answered which was logical enough, though who knew he’d think that quickly to do in this situation despite it risking pain towards himself. “Now are we going to just stand here? Let’s go find that Luradis person and actually fight them!” Bendy added now which everyone agreed, Sans gesturing a bit of the idea of the way to go which everyone began to head that way. </p>

<p>Luckily not many more COTS came towards during it, sure a few tried but were quickly handled with by the group, just now to that large crowd of COTS again at where what must be abouts where Luradis is, just got to figure a way through there somehow and surely can’t try what Bendy did before. “Any ideas here?” Baldi asked the rest which Mugman thought of one it seems. “What if we use the necklace Brook has for a distraction? Then Bendy can retrieve it before any of those COTS can get it?” Mugman asked which was a reasonable idea that’s worth a shot. Brook got her necklace off and aimed to throw it which Sans gave an idea on the general direction while Bendy listened in and got ready, once Brook threw it, Bendy quickly sunk into the ground to go after it, seeing it land from a good enough distance that alerted the COTS to go after it, giving an opening for the rest the group to quickly sneak on by to the entrance to wherever Luradis is, seeing Bendy get to the necklace right when the COTS were very close and Bendy took it with him back into the puddle he went into, seeing all of the COTS roar in anger and some tried to attack the ground where Bendy previously was. Bendy quickly came out from a puddle once he was where the group was as they all quickly entered another one of these dice of sorts as they all took a breather now. “That was close” Bendy spoke up, handing the necklace back to Brook which Brook got and began to put the necklace back on. Baldi was studying the room though for what can be noticed, he looks unsure of the area which isn’t a good sign sometimes in these cases, making the group look to Baldi concerned. “Compared to the other ones like this, this one seems much more dense in this case. Is this normal Mugman?” Baldi asked which Mugman looked back and shook his head a little. </p>

<p>“Not really, last time I was out all the way here all I could remember is this room being only a little dense but not so bad…” Mugman explained which surely makes it not a good sign in this case, but it also could be perhaps a sign that the person must be out here and they’re close, but who knows for sure. “Well whatever it is we can take it!” Bendy spoke up but yet everyone wasn’t certain, this spot felt like it drained it a little bit of the idea of things working, which yet to notice Bendy was worried by though interestingly he wasn’t affected. Brook studied the area a little more and studied the other way through to the other side looking obscured in a darkness, in fact to realize this whole spot appeared darker and more almost negative. Bendy tried to more quietly cheer on again but Sans seemed uncertain and Baldi looked to be studying the room and not so sure and yet Mugman who would normally be positive felt unsettled in this spot which got Bendy to feel that a bit to, this place is doing something and something surely not pleasant. Brook although she wasn’t going to let this bother her and she knows there has to be a way and maybe it’s just to force it out, so she went over to the door which everyone looked to her confused and concerned and she opened the door to the way to where Luradis is believed to be and yet the whole spot brightened up again. </p>

<p>Which yet felt like whatever was in the space drained out, maybe it was them trying to put some trick on them which yet the group seemed more ready, though there were quickly some questions upon this. “Odd how this room gave a negative energy. How did you figure that’ll work?” Baldi asked which Brook looked over than to Bendy slowly. “I guess I learned that even if there is darkness there is always something to find through it all.” Brook answered which Bendy looked happy hearing that but focused now. “Alright! Now who's ready to win another battle against these guys!??” Bendy spoke up which everyone agreed with and quickly the group went out to see if they could find Luradis out here. Which checking around can see a large brute COTS near one of the large buildings there just destroying what's nearby and trying to destroy the building but it appears the building keeps rebuilding itself like magic versus the rest as can see Luradis nearby it further away and shouting at it to get the job done, there they are. The group quickly went over readying to handle Luradis till quickly a part of some of the place nearby came flying at them which Bendy and Sans got everyone to quickly move aside for upon seeing it, luckily nobody was hurt, then laughter followed after they dodged it. </p>

<p>“Well Well Well! You came right back to try and do something about all of this here huh? How cute! Wanting to be heroes for this little universe and be admired! Ohhh how it makes me laugh!” Luradis spoke up, walking over while can tell she was entertained as the large brute COTS had stopped attacking the building and looked over at them all as well, which yet surely meant this could get dangerous now. “It surprises me you all even got out of there alive! Seems you all must have some oh so very intriguing powers!” Luradis spoke on more and looked at them all, surely clear they are dying to know everybody's powers for perhaps who knows what reasons which yet Bendy was the first to get defensive for everyone. “AND IF YOU THINK YOU GONNA GET TO DO ANYTHING WITH SEEING OUR POWERS THEN OH IT WILL BE SURE YOU AIN’T GONNA DO NOTHING TO US!” Bendy shouted in anger, readying to walk over to fight but quickly Mugman pulled him back while looking at Luradis and decided to try to make this more peaceful in some way. “Let’s think about this, look mrs, we all don’t have to fight and you can help make this all stop! There can be peace instead for everyone!” Mugman explained trying to see if Luradis really does want to do this and maybe Luradis could become good instead but yet Luradis laughed very loudly upon hearing that. </p>

<p>“OH THAT’S GOT TO BE THE BEST JOKE I’VE HEARD VERSUS THE ONES I HEARD WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BACK AT THAT TRASHY PLACE! MAKE PEACE??? REALLY? MAKE EVERYTHING ALL SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS!?” Luradis laughed louder after speaking as she then took a moment to calm down and gave a look that showed that did nothing to change her mind. “Oh you are so childish to think like that. My boss has already given me everything I can ever ask for after all.” Luradis continued once she calmed down which yet can tell got Bendy upset seeing Mugman feel a little hurt after trying to make peace which Bendy was ready to attack but was held back by Sans quickly before he could though that didn’t stop the angry shouting. “OH YOUR LUCKY YOU HAD SOMEONE GIVE YOU SOME MERCY AFTER THE SHIT YOU PULLED EARLIER TO HURT SOMEONE LIKE ALL OF THOSE OTHER ANNOYING BAD GUYS WHICH WE WILL HURT YOU LIKE THOSE GUYS IF YOU KEEP THIS ATTITUDE UP!” Bendy yelled with all so much anger thank god for Sans to hold him back since who knows how dangerous it’ll be to go charging in especially when there's a large brute COTS right by Luradis who looked ready to attack in case Bendy did try coming over. Luradis seemed yet only entertained by this and laughed a little seeing Bendys whole reaction as Sans kept him back which yet Mugman and Brook tried to calm him down now while Baldi decided to carry on the questioning and speaking in this situation. </p>

<p>“Look, we are making some fair points around here, we shouldn’t have to fight, everyones lives are on the line if anything happens to any universe. By studying practically all the COTS they are uncontrollable and will stop assisting when things get worse. Think more carefully about this, do you really want to go through with this and help someone who could possibly not care if anything happened to you?” Baldi questioned which Luradis listened in then began to laugh again at this. It really does appear there is no convincing anyone who is like this is there? “Who wouldn’t want to see some devastation! Plus these creatures clearly all follow orders so well it’s like they were born to follow them! So there are no concerns! Now. Quit this little chit chat and let’s cut to a part where it’s much more entertaining!” Luradis spoke up, snapping her fingers seeing then the large COTS raise its hands up high and quickly try to hit them all by slamming there hands onto them but quickly saw Sans summon a bone cage around the group to block it while everyone is protected as well which hit the bones breaking them from the impact but it surely did save the group from a fatal blow. </p>


<p>“You guys okay?” Sans asked everyone which yet everyone nodded and began to quickly prepare now for this fight as the large COTS stepped back like they were waiting for another order to do this which yet Luradis seemed intrigued perhaps even entertained by this. “Well well well! Look at that! Oh that’s a good taste for what to see in this.” Luradis spoke up, having that twisted grin on her face. “Well prepare to see more if so since we are going to use our powers to deal with you!” Bendy shouted which Luradis laughed upon hearing as she raised her hand clearly giving the sign to the large brute COTS that it’s time to fight, which before she got it to start she smiled looking at the group speaking up. “You're funny, truly, but I doubt that dream will ever come true.” Which by the snap of her fingers, that’s when the large brute COTS came charging for them making it clear the battle had now begun.</p>

<h5>Does it hurt to lose control like that?</h5>
<h5>Or is it empty when it all bursts out?</h5>
<h5>Are we a new person upon a burst of power?</h5>
<h5>Or just ourselves controlled by blinded rage?</h5>

<h2>Chapter 14. Bamboozled</h2>

<p>Hitting each and every tree, hitting the ground and other rough spots while being swung around and hit with that machinery before being tossed into one the trees and hanging there still trapped within the net still struggling to get free while being quite hurt once again due to all of that and just stuck having to look at Uvilein whos upside down in one's view. Which Brook can see Uvilein laughing at this current situation she's in while seemingly pressing a button on his outfit to quickly change it’s form to something that seems he more so prefers having now a white and light gray lab coat on with a odd heart logo with a stitching around the outline of the heart as he got rid of the hat and has just black pants and boots that matched with the theme. He looked at his outfit and then to Brook now as he slowly came over having that to figure to be an evil smile. “My, my! I surely must’ve been lucky to have come across you guys, especially you gem holder!” Uvilein spoke with such smart confidence in his voice as he went over to Brook for where she was just stuck hanging there. </p>

<p>“Bendy really was onto something about you…” Brook spoke up, which Uvilein gave an annoyed smile once hearing that while having a look that said he must’ve been aware of this. “EUGH- That damn annoyance wouldn’t shut up each time I did anything and oh for how protective he was around you SOMETHING Had to be done to make him back away and luckily I was far smart enough to get that to happen.” Uvilein spoke with some annoyance in his voice but went back to this snarky like tone he has going on now as he continued on. “Oh but no matter now, I was lucky that the skeleton was just a great distraction for this matter, Probably because of all that talking I did about some dark related topics!” Uvilein smiled more, turning away and imagining it all for perhaps the reactions he got out of all of it, oh how twisted for this guy to do that. “That’s why he- How could you do that!? That’s not right to do to people to trick and force them into doing things they don’t wish to do or feel they have to do even! It breaks the person and normally when it comes to these bad things karma hits them hard.” Brook explained, managing to shift a bit around in the net to find a proper position to be in so that way she can focus more to find some way out. </p>

<p>“And who would hit me with karma when knowing it those guys won’t find us out here and surely my bosses side man you may already know is just on his way so can take care of you before they can do much, there's nothing you can do, bonus that everyone else who could are already too broken to do much, who could you possibly think would be capable of doing such a thing like that?” Uvilein looked to Brook as he countered that explanation, just going over to where the net is having a dark smile on his face, something that felt it was to show there couldn’t be hope on making him stop or hope karma can strike this twisted man, but, it still feels there is. “You’d be surprised how powerful some things can be without noticing I guess..” Brook quietly added, which made Uvilein give a look that seemed confused not understanding it, even though Brook wasn’t confident herself if she was right herself but it was the hope this could leave Uvilein to weaken and be distracted so she could escape. “You know that surely is a quite interesting thesis, In Fact even when it comes towards you. Maybe there is a lot more to why you carry such a gem around. Perhaps something far greater than oh what we know of! HAHA! Oh this surely must mean I shall secure you good so you won’t ever escape.” Uvilein spoke up with a laugh-like tone in his voice which made Brook worry more, that foiled clearly. </p>

<p>Uvilein then quickly shot out another net that quickly went around the other one has he had a mechanical arm that had a more claw like hand come out from to guess a piece of machinery on his back to go up and tie the access on where the other access was so it securely stays up there, just smiling throughout it, making it clear Brook surely should’ve thought this further through, but there has to be some way out, she has to fight for herself here. That’s when she noticed something from within the forest quickly sneaking abouts it seemingly, Uvilein didn’t seem to notice since he was focused on making sure one is secured within the net but one saw slightly something pink-ish red pass by within the trees and shadows, which was quick to figure for Brook, maybe they have a plan to help somehow even if there- unique of course, so Brook looked to Uvilein and thought up ways she could try to distract him more incase. </p>

<p>“So you're controlling Alovo?...” “Oh a quick thing to go saying now, But please! He is just as bad as that Balaur guy that grinny guy mentioned that you encountered, perhaps worse!” Uvilein exclaimed with a tone in his voice that feels one can recognize now to be lying, he has to be lying, Alovo would’ve not saved her before and or cared to give any info, it's a lie. “Is lying your way of handling the truth of things? Is the truth that scary to you?” Brook questioned which Uvilein gave a judging look upon hearing that now. “HOW- HOW DARE YOU ASSUME I COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A MENTAL ISSUE SUCH AS SOMETHING LIKE THAT! I CAN VERY WELL SAY THE TRUTH ABOUT THINGS!” “Then how come you haven’t before?” Brook added on to Uvileins upset speech, which seems her adding that only made him more upset, but it at least is distracting him more. “Ohhh- Oh ho ho ho… I see what you’re trying to pull, oh I see now… This is part of your plan is it? To keep me held up here long enough so you can escape once I’m distracted enough, or even by chance get someone to come by. </p>

<p>Oh ho ho I see. But unfortunately for you, There’s more to this net program I have set up now in case of these situations, Unless of course, you quiet down or perhaps could provide me with some more helpful information.” Uvilein said, looking over to Brook who was quietly nervous for if Uvilein was figuring it but hid it despite that being potentially the case. “What information?” “Oh something simple, such as this: How did you get that gem? Are you aware of what it can even do? Those things are so strong it could be the perfect amount of fuel for creating a portal! And those take a lot of magical energy to begin with. You’re holding something that yet can put you at such dangerous risk! With such a thing it’s not safe to carry around for anyone, if we just could figure out where you could have got it then it won’t put you at such danger now.” Uvilein answered Brooks question, providing quite a bit of information on such a thing, which yet how was Brook to even answer this of course, she doesn’t know exactly where herself anyways she was just gifted it as a nice little present after all.  </p>


<p>"But...I don't know how exactly I got it since it was a gift after all, pretty sure you're not supposed to say where you got it unless asked..." Brook explained the best she could, which seems Uvilein wasn't liking that kind of answer, not one bit it seems. "Oh ho ho I see, I see... You're just not admitting aren't you? In fact the way you look so aware of what it is surely is intriguing, what aren't you saying now?" Uvilein had a twisted like smile on his face now as he got closer to the net seeming he had some kind of twisted intention currently, but how would she know? she only learnt it from that book and a bit off of that Balaur guy. "I'm being honest here about it being a gift and not just that but also I don't know that much on the gem thing, I only heard so much about it here I'm not an expert-" </p>

<p>"BULL OF SHIT LADY! I call bullshit! You lie! If you wouldn't have known you would've never kept wearing it! especially for someone who is someone without powers clearly!" Uvilein exclaimed with annoyance in his tone, which made Brook worried and kinda try to move further away, she doesn't like that tone surely, god come on something just happen.</p>

<h5>Down.</h5>

<p>Is what then echoed in her head which quickly made her move downwards trusting that voice like before seeing a hammer fly by that Uvilein just dodged but hit one the arms as it hit the branch to break it making the net fall and her with which made her hit the ground quite quicker but it's better then being hit with a hammer or Uvilein attempting whatever he had planned. Which Uvilein quickly turned behind him going "You!" knowing exactly who threw that hammer which was Alovo who seemed to have thrown the hat he had that covered his eyes off seeing just that curly messy like hair and those black empty eyes that matched the expression he always has while was clear his head looked injured maybe even more for getting it off but can tell he was focused on Uvilein."Oh, now you want to try and disobey after all that's gone on, huh? You think you can just go back now? Alovo, Kid, Come on, You can't go back to being normal, you're too h-" "Don't listen to him Alovo! He's just trying to hurt you!" Brook interrupted Uvilein, which made Uvilein look over with a glare seeming to get one of his machines ready, aiming at the net. </p>

<p>Quickly saw Alovo tackle him down getting his hammer again with his tail while just laying on him to keep him there but Uvilein quickly had a robotic arm come out from his back to pick up and throw Alovo off which Alovo caught himself fast getting his hammer ready and charged at Uvilein but he quickly blocked it and began to aim and shoot at Alovo which Alovo dodged fast. During this Brook quickly rolled along the ground managing to force the branch along and quickly rolled more into the forest just finding a bush with some sharp ends and attempts to have that help break the net shes in which after a few tries she did suddenly get it to break a layer and then the next quite quickly just getting free from it but she wasn't done yet. Quickly she took it and snuck over to a spot on the side Uvilein was which seems Alovo was aware managing to hit Uvilein back enough for Brook to throw the net over Uvileins head which Uvilein struggled even if in pain but yet seems he wasn't worried strangely which does get explained when he quickly rolls his body that made Brook move quickly and managed to make her hit into a tree. </p>

<p>Which he wasn't done for just got the net off and tightened it in a way to almost have it rope like or possible to use like one while a robotic arm in his back held Alovo back fast and threw Alovo far too, which Brook still has the strength to get up despite the pain, just getting up and quickly   moved over to a spot to step on something being the branch the net was stuck to still, picking it up the best she could which seems to have confused Uvilein. "You want the net? Take it four eyes!” Brook then quickly threw it hard at Uvilein which Uvilein quickly tried to dodge or have a robotic arm catch but Alovo had just enough time to get each one tangled since they were focused on him as the branch hit. This annoyed Uvilein, causing Uvilein to quickly get a machinery out that became a larger machinery and quickly aimed it to Alovo first, which he then quickly began to shoot at Alovo causing Alovo to dodge all abouts fast, giving Brook time to flee to get the others to help with this mess they're in. </p>

<p>As checking back to where Brook was before she got too far can see Alovo get hit by the machinery seeing him get trapped into this rope that began to zap him, which can see Uvilein laugh and try to find Brook now with a crazed look on his face which made Brook get far fast. It's just the hope now she can find the rest but where is anyone? She's hit too many things already, how is she to remember what ways they took? Come on figure something. "Bendy? Mugman? Sans??" Brook called out as she walked on, but no response, nobody heard. She continued onward, she'd call for others but- she doesn't want to risk it being someone bad to come checking which maybe makes calling for the rest a bad idea too. Till she stopped and saw going by a spot there were some purple flowers of some kind, which matched the one she got when in this world, odd, maybe weirdly it's a sign? Well wouldn't be a surprise like everything else around here. So she tried to find more like it, finding almost a path going on with it all she followed till it ended at some point but for where she was she did hear something being someone calling for her, Mugman. </p>

<p>She then quickly went to where she heard it while shouting "Mugman!" As she went to it, which can also hear the calling from Mugman get closer too like he was also following it, till soon she can see him from not far, thank goodness it's him. "BROOK!" Mugman shouted with a smile on his face quickly running over and hugging her out of happy relief which surprised Brook but she did end up hugging back not minding how he did this in which she looked up and saw the rest coming over now for they must've saw Mugman running and tried to follow, which made Mugman let go and notice them with more of a smile on his face as he excitedly goes "I found her I found her!" which relaxed the other two seeing both are okay and here. "I KNEW IT THAT GUY WAS OFF! I KNEW HE HAD THAT FEELING ABOUT HIM OF THIS TWISTED LADY I KNEW!" Bendy exclaimed as he got over which can tell he was annoyed about what's happened. "You know something was off about the guy when we met him." Sans spoke up, going by to and kept an eye out incase of any dangers. "OHHH YOU DON'T THINK MR SMART GUY?" Bendy spoke with more annoyance which can guess these two must've discussed this before which Sans just sighed at not able to do much about Bendys whole reaction. </p>

<p>“It’s lucky that I was able to recognize the signs OTHERWISE HE COULD’VE KILLED US QUITE A BIT AGO!” Bendy exclaimed with more annoyance in his voice as he looked at Sans mostly perhaps to put this maybe more on him in some way which Sans only listened not able to do much on it, but Bendy then now settled down as he looked to Brook and Mugman now. “Luckily we got Mugman though, you really helped out there” “Aw thank you! I couldn’t just leave her to be taken. She's important to you guys clearly and plus she’s really nice too so how could I not?” Mugman happily responded to Bendys little compliment with such a sweet happy tone which is always nice to see how he reacts in such a way like that. “Okay now, let’s focus, I think I remember the way back to where he is so let’s get back there and see if we can stop this guy to get info! Before he tries to attack us first” Brook explained with a bit of a speech which everyone nodded readying for it already as Brook turned to where it was before seeing those flowers and began to follow them causing the rest to follow quickly, it’s surely time to handle this guy for good.</p>

<p>Quickly they got there fast to the spot even if Brook found there was more flowers then before for the way to it but once there can see Uvilein must’ve been mocking Alovo during that time and seems to have destroyed the area quite a bit but something about it seemed off at least to Bendy it seems since Bendy didn’t go in right away, which Mugman though did try to once seeing Alovo trapped and hurt but Bendy stopped him right away, studying the area it seems then looking to Sans. “Throw something at him.” “What?” Trust me, just throw something at him” Bendy told Sans which although Sans was confused he yet still summoned a bone and tossed it at Uvilein, which hit Uvilein at the side of the head making Uvielin quickly look, but Bendy quickly moved everyone to a side Uvilein won’t see them all on, which seems just listening can hear Uvielin begin to search for them but almost in an odd manner for how he dodged some spots and went right away to some while missing them completely for where they hid, surely must mean he must’ve placed traps. </p>
<p>“Knew it.” “How did you know to do that?” Brook asked Bendy once Bendy said that, which Bendy looked at her now once hearing that. “If he was such a genius he’d know we’d come right back and knowing it he’d set traps so his job can be easier done! That’s obvious to do if you were hunting anything even if it’s people.” Bendy explained, which made the rest look at him but keep an eye out after incase now for if Uvilein tries to find them. Can see Uvilein move closer to the trees and bushes which made everyone stay quiet and closer together, which Bendy gave a signal to Sans to go around and attack him from behind and that he’ll follow which Sans and Bendy began to do that remaining quiet and sneaky while Brook and Mugman stayed where they are, keeping an eye on where Uvilein is, which Brook got an idea to make Uvilein be more distracted by finding a rock on the ground and throwing it to a spot which seems Uvilein noticed and studied the area more, who knows how smoothly this will go but it’s a hope it goes well for the most part. Then quickly Sans threw a bone at the back of Uvileins head before more could happen which made Uvilein turn seeing Bendy charge at him after but quickly shot this machinery at him that practically grabbed hold of him before throwing him away. </p>

<p>Can see Uvilein then press a button on his coat hearing all the traps around where Brook and Mugman hid go off, both managing to dodge one that was in front of them, oh the battle has begun. Quickly once all the traps are done Brook and Mugman found some way out making sure they won’t get in the attacks that are being thrown around seeing Sans shoot at Uvilein but quickly Uvilein shot back at him with all sorts of machinery before managing to trap him in one of them while Bendy tried to get Uvilein from behind but quickly got Bendy trapped as well. This made Mugman worry and even at that without thinking of the dangers he rushed in to try and help already shooting at Uvilein but Uvilein quickly with ease shot a net at Mugman to trap him, leaving it to be just Brook at the moment who has to get everyone free. “Oh Brook I know you're out there hiding, all of you thought it would be just that easy to do this? Oh how hilarious! Poor ambush attempt truly. But come on now, why don’t you come on out now and accept defeat? Then all of you can come scot free!” Uvilein spoke loudly, looking around now for Brook which can see the rest trying to escape but couldn’t, this is bad, she has to figure something here if she wants everyone to be free. </p>

<h5>Don’t give in…</h5>

<p>She heard that voice go through her head again, there has to be a way, if these are the same nets Uvilein used before perhaps, then that means they're pretty easy to break, it’s just a matter of getting one, so a distraction was needed, she just needs someone to distract Uvilein, which she quickly looked to see if anyone would notice her which was Mugman since Mugman knew where she was and she gave a hint to Mugman to pass the message on trying to distract Uvilein, which Mugman understood quickly and looked to the rest to pass the hint along, it’s going to plan, hopefully. “So what do you plan to do now? Planning to keep us caught like this?” Sans spoke up first which Uvilein looked at him and laughed a bit. “Are you really chatting during a time like this of being caught? Well unless you know you're practically defeated now, Guess it wouldn’t hurt to talk a bit since your friend will come out and give up eventually. You won’t be in those nets forever, you will come out of those to be locked up a different way and used for testing! Powers after all are such a unique thing to see for some.” “Testing?? Really??? THAT’S what you're planning to do? You know I thought a ‘genius’ would have a smarter idea than that since aren’t geniuses like you to rely more on machines then powers??” </p>

<p>Bendy shouted a bit, giving a look at Uvilein which made Uvilein look at him and go to him giving a look of sure he’s smiling but he is not happy, which bought Brook some time to get close to Mugmans net first and pull it over to where she was while she brought over the branch she had ready for this beginning to cut open a hole for Mugman on one the sharper ends while Mugman kept watch to be sure Uvilein won’t notice this. “Oh you practical child you, all of you are practically children who can’t understand the meaning of what power is! Powers is what can be used to fuel machinery. How else do you think the portals work??” “I don’t know maybe something like a engine that can process fuels that are strong enough to create things into existence and trigger some endless cycle with it all to create endless amounts which can make a valve that opens to the main source that it could also infinitely flow through and trigger energy perhaps enough to cause it?” Bendy rambled on which made Uvilein stare at him with this bewildered look on his face even though sure he must’ve understood he just seems more confused how Bendy went on about all of this, which guess said more how he got upset earlier when Uvilein tried to push everyone to think Bendy was bad when he wasn’t at all. Least throughout all of this gave them more time where Brook almost got Mugman free now just got to be careful. </p>

<p>Thus Brook got Mugman free from the net which Mugman quietly sneaked out from to be by Brooks side as both make their way to Sans since Bendy is distracting Uvilein quite a lot. “OH YOU DAMN DUMBASS I AM TELLING YOU THAT ISN’T HOW THAT SHIT WORKS! YOUR CLAIMING YOUR A MACHINE EXPERT BUT YET YOU ARE SAYING LITERALLY INK CAN CREATE ENOUGH ENERGY TO DO THINGS IT’S NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THAT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN USE THAT STUFF AS A POWER AND IT ISN’T CAPABLE TO FUEL A PORTAL OR ANYTHING THAT GRAND!” Uvilein shouted at Bendy with such an annoyance in his tone which Bendy just focused on him just seeming annoyed as well. “Oh really? What if theres like types of inks that can be a thing and you and I are just thinking of different ones which I thought a genius who is focused on the powers thing would know-” “YOU AND THAT ‘maybe your dumb’ STUFF IS GETTING REAL ANNOYING THERE YOU DAMN BURNT CROISSANT! YOU KNOW WHAT!?? YOU KNOW WHAT??? THAT’S IT!” Uvilein shouted interrupting Bendy while it seemed he got out a machine from his pocket and aimed it towards Bendy watching it open a few things and begin to charge something up which Bendy looked at seeming to quietly get worried, maybe he did this too much. </p>

<p>Though quickly since the rest got Sans out much faster since it was twice the effort to break the net Sans got out and seemed to quickly shoot Uvilein which Uvilein dodged and looked at him shocked and confused how he got out but also more annoyed at that. “OH YOU MANAGED TO GET OUT NOW?? BUT YOU WON’T BE FOR THAT MUCH LONGER FOOLISH SKELETON!” Uvilein shouted as he aimed the weapon at him and began shooting as he laughed a maniac like laugh as Sans dodged each one and focused on attacking Uvilein, Uvilein is luckily still distracted so Brook and Mugman quickly got over to where Bendy was helping him free which he looks tired out and thankful for. “You’re so brave for doing all of that, Bendy!” Mugman said quietly to Bendy while they helped get him free from this net. “Yeah that’s true, it takes a lot of strength to even just face a danger like that” Brook added on which Bendy just looked at them both and smiled. “You both are really nice, now! Come on we better hurry, there's a fight we gotta help in!” Bendy smiled as he looked to where the fighting was going on which the other two got Bendy out quickly from the net which Bendy noticed fast and climbed out of it and quickly began to charge into attack, causing Mugman to follow after to help then Brook as well once getting the net moved aside. </p>

<p>Which can watch Bendy quickly tackle Uvilein down hard into the ground as tried to steal the weapon from Uvilein but Uvilein got the robotic arms out from his back that he had to throw Bendy off but Bendy quickly caught himself so the fall didn’t hurt so bad when he got thrown. Sans quickly shot out a lot of bones out from the ground towards Uvilein during this which Uvilein quickly managed to dodge most of it even though some hit into his arms and legs but he was still going and shot at Sans to try and kill him by chance but Mugman shot the gun at his arms to try and force him to drop it which Uvilein quickly switched it to a robotic arm that came out from his back to hold on and begin to shoot at Mugman, which Brook quickly came by managing to pick Mugman up fast and help Mugman dodge any of the attacks much faster since otherwise Mugman would’ve struggled with that. All of this must’ve been annoying Uvilein more so he got more robotic arms out from his back to all start targeting each one of them, which quickly Sans was able to force the arm over to where the one going for Bendy was to twist them and which him and Bendy quickly ran over to do the same thing to the other arm fast. Which Uvielin quickly tried to get them untangled but couldn’t for he struggled in doing so. Quickly everyone saw the chance and quickly all went up to him to all do a larger attack together, which when Brook grabbed her pencil to use as a weapon just saw everything seem more pixelated but more colorful kind of like the other universe did it seeing lines around and a more pixel version of how everyone looked before just like that they all tackled Uvilein to cause him to drop his weapon and not be capable of fighting more. </p>

<p>Uvilein fell to the ground as everyone stood above Uvilein looking at him and even Bendy ready to make sure he wouldn't dare go anywhere. “HAH! TAKE THAT!” Bendy shouted while looking to Uvilein who looked to everyone just tired from the fighting and seeming to be preparing something perhaps for an escape. “Ohhh, If I really did need you guys to assist with something it would say how strong you are…. But as well as unsuspecting.” Uvilein spoke with a weak tone but then had a small grin, raising his hand and pressing a button seeing then a portal show from behind him and yet another one nearby but why? Then saw Mugman fall right into that portal since saw he must’ve been trying to help Alovo who was still passed out from way before, causing Brook and Sans to go over to it fast, but Bendy tried to go after Uvilein out of anger but Uvilein laughed and got into the portal before Bendy could do more, the portal vanishing right before him. “SHIT! NOT AGAIN!” Bendy shouted, which made Brook and Sans look over for a second then the portal. “Welp, Nobody is getting left behind.” Sans spoke up, then suddenly went into the portal. “WAIT- Oh… Well, Bendy, are you coming?” Brook spoke up looking at Bendy who seemed angry and thinking of it all, then looked at Brook just staring before giving a small smile as he went over. “Alright! Perhaps this one has someone as well! Soooo- COME ON!” Bendy shouted a bit at the end, quickly getting hold of Brook’s arm as he fell in pulling her along which surprised Brook as they fell in and the portal closed. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Past</h2>

 <p>The group quickly went forward, going through the halls checking around trying to find where Nuqx was in case that wherever that crash was didn’t mean anything bad was coming, looking for any signs or anything, each corner, each room, but yet nothing was found no matter where they checked. Soon, when the group was quite far now, they all took a moment to take a break and pause, guess now works as a good time to figure what’s happened and to explain to some the newest members maybe even catch up what’s been going on, Especially since right away when they stopped Jevil tried to attack Mugman but Sans quickly got Jevil to not do so. “Okay seriously! Real quick- Sans, Baldi, Who is this guy you found and WHY DO THEY KEEP TRYING TO HURT US??” Bendy asked while the search was still half going on but the current focus was trying to get answers here. “This is Jevil, we ran into them and to prevent them from causing damage around for apparently no reason, we brought them along to be some help, which so far Jevil has been quite helpful.” Sans explained, looking to Jevil who looked over at Sans then to the rest and bowed a bit while having that grin on their face. “PLEASANTRIES TO MEET,MEET YOU FOLKS!” Jevil announced before laughing a bit, then looking at them all. “Well, Nice to meet you, I am Brook, This is Bendy, This is Mugman and This is Sonic.” Brook gave a proper greeting back since it is the right to do while helping introduce who is who to Jevil as well which Sans and Baldi seemed a little confused about Sonic since they haven’t properly met. </p>

<p>“So, Who is-” “Oh me? I am the first to meet Brook actually before she encountered you all when this portal thing began! Though winded up being split up due to each of us following into portals of sorts” Sonic quickly explained right when Baldi began to ask which at least answers that question. “Well, nice to meet you then Sonic. I am Sans and this is Baldi.” Sans then gave an introduction for who they are which Sonic smiled once having gotten that introduction now to who they are. “Great to meet you all as well! Looks like this is all quite the team here we got going on!” Sonic looked around as he said that to everyone which to think it did really form a team of sorts. “HAHA! TEAM,TEAM? OH WHAT A FUN,FUN WORD!” Jevil laughed hearing the word team, though it wasn’t to poke fun at it but seemed to kind of enjoy the thought, which to blame it is a nice little thought process. “Maybe we can all be a team of friends?? Not only stopping this but all being friends?” Mugman asked everyone which everyone looked not expecting it, sure quite a few can say kinda are friends at this point right? But to think all of them can be, well… “Absolutely! After all, friendship only makes this team stronger then!” Sonic cheered which got Bendy hyped up next. “Yeah! Actually that sounds awesome! All working together but also being close with one another!” Bendy cheered a bit in too which seemed the rest were thinking a bit though Jevil seemed for the most part confused. </p>

<p>“WHAT ARE, ARE FRIENDS?” Jevil asked, while the rest looked at Jevil not expecting that. “They’re people who care about you and are there for you! Can even play games together or do fun things together with a friend!” Mugman explained to Jevil with a smile, Jevil was thinking, being confused at first but then they grinned widely once they heard the games part and fun things part too. “OH THAT SOUNDS,SOUNDS WONDERFUL! WE ALL MUST BECOME,BECOME FRIENDS THAN THIS INSTANT!” Jevil exclaimed, seeming to enjoy such a thought though maybe for the wrong reasons. “You forgot to say you can’t hurt friends or try to kill them either-” “YOU! YOU BE THE FIRST, FIRST FRIEND!” Jevil interrupted Sans while Sans was trying to hint at Jevil that to ensure nothing gets pulled but yet Sans was just surprised how Jevil was quick to going for Sans first for the friendship thing, which everyone laughed a little seeing it all, guess that works as a start for at least that and gets everyone to know one another more. Though then heard voices ahead, causing everyone to go quiet, they must be getting close, Brook was quick to figure which way it is, beginning to lead the way as everyone began to follow with, all ready for whatever is to come, each taking a turn from different directions till reaching the spot which quickly Sonic was able to pull them all aside from being seen due to being quick to notice whats up as Baldi found a way for them all to be able to see what's going on without being caught. Which sure enough can see Nuqx was talking to someone all too familiar for a lot of them, seeming it was Stiex again who this time, looked a bit injured in some way not by Nuqx clearly but from something else judging the injuries either being cuts or odd patterns of sorts, which Nuqx was nearby Stiex studying them and seeming to ask what's going on, though everyone was surely curious on what happened, was the crashes from Stiex? But that wouldn’t make sense for how the injuries are since neither Ezose or Clubtacka can do that, so what happened? Guess it’s best right now to focus and truly listen in while ensuring none of the group can be caught or seen or trying to attempt anything which Sans was already ensuring that. “Stiex you didn’t have to come all this way!... You should be resting after what St-” </p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t even fucking say his name right now. What to focus on right now is what I actually came here for, which I still need to tell more properly to Ezose about.” Stiex interrupted Nuqx when Nuqx was going to say the name of someone while yet quick to switch the topic to something that should as well be important to know. Nuqx looked at Stiex worriedly but listened in anyways as Stiex seemed to check around first, before focusing on Nuqx again, this time there has to be something here, something that has to be known, which yet, finally comes the chance. “You know the time we get back, correct? Back to fucking all the shit back in our universe. When we get back during then for him to begin whatever else he has planned next for us to do. I will need you to leave when you hear four screams. Stick by the rest, they will know the same thing. Four screams, Leave and I will meet you after.” Stiex went on to explain, making the group confused but concerned, for all the times that was known about this, this doesn't make sense. “Wh… Stiex what is- what is going to happen?... What about you during then?..” Nuqx was quick to ask, seeming concerned by this as Stiex looked to Nuqx keeping their focus on them but can tell Stiex was giving a calm look to Nuqx in some way, interesting even despite how serious he is there are hints of a way he expresses things. “I will be busy. To keep it simple since I know you aren’t a big fucking fan of the shit said too. Things are going to change, for the better of us all. I will ensure that for good so no more shit like this ever happens.” </p>

<p>Stiex gestured when saying the last bit to Nuqx’s injuries he has, which Nuqx though looked to his was looking to Stiex’s injuries as well, clearly hinting that, this surely means from all the clues and ideas since the beginning, there's something far worse going on behind the scenes of everything with these people, far worse that just left a bad feeling knowing it. “Stiex… You’re not planning to…” “I am.” Stiex quickly answered Nuqx when Nuqx was asking something that must surely involve it all, which Nuqx seemed more worried about hearing that is yet the plan. “Stiex no! That’s dangerous!.. They could really hurt you or…” “Kill me? There's one thing that prevents them from doing so, you're aware of that, right? Sure they can fucking hurt me, but, remember what I told you and the rest all about what I found out I can do? None of them would be able to fucking stand a chance against it. Plus, we wouldn’t want any more of this shit going on here, right?” Stiex went on to explain it all to Nuqx again who showed more worry and concern which yet left Nuqx with not much of a response to it, so this was why they kept seeing Stiex from universe to universe, they were planning to presumingly deal with some the people, maybe even go right to the boss of it all to take care of them, but for how it sounded, it seemed to dangerous, let alone to even do so alone, there has to be something they can do here although may not be the greatest idea to, would be worth to try and at least help them, right? As that thought process went through their heads, when Brook turned to tell everyone they noticed that Jevil was missing, which made her quickly look to Sans who noticed Brook look and checked around realizing it too, that can’t be good. “Has anyone else seen where Jevil went?” Sans whispered to everyone which everyone looked and listened in then realizing Jevils gone causing each of everyone to look around while as well before shaking their heads, clearly nobody has seen where Jevil has gone now. “I’ll go find him” Brook whispered out to the group, quickly going ahead to start searching which nobody can really say anything on how one shouldn’t but yet she already began to go back down the hall they came from to begin to search which yet shortly after can hear Sans seeming to come along which is fair he knows how to best handle with Jevil after all. While the rest for now kept an eye on seeing if Stiex would leave Nuqx at any given point for them to have a chance to get some answers about what's going on which shows the team's effort for this. Brook and Sans walked on away from them all and quickly began to take different halls to figure out where Jevil could have gone even checking different rooms for anything of the sorts of a clue for where Jevil was, but there was no clue exactly on where he could’ve ran off to, hopefully it doesn’t mean anything bad. </p>

<p>As they searched, Sans was deep in thought as they went, which yet made Brook wonder, but it would be rude to just directly ask, so Brook just thought of more so a different way to at least lead to having some form of an answer, plus bring some conversation as they searched. “Was surely a lot of info we got out of that situation.. Not the brightest info which is a wonder if that made Jevil run off” Brook tried to pick up some form of conversation which Sans looked to Brook once hearing that after peaking into another one the rooms had no luck with that once again. “Well that’s a reasonable theory since when meeting Jevil seems he too has dealt with a few stuff before this. Leaves questions that, for everyone we met, DDraig, Stiex, Alovo, Solgo, now Ezose and Nuqx, it’s clear they all are experiencing some forms of pain but, for how long is the question? Since the other guys like Balaur, Uvilein, Luradis and Clubtacka now don’t seem to deal with any of that but seem more like..” “Like they bring the pain?” Brook finished what Sans was saying showing she understood what Sans was getting at, which Sans gave a nod to show Brook was right on what he was trying to say there. “Who knows right now, though you said too when saying about the meeting Jevil thing, did… that situation stress you perhaps as well? Sorry if that’s too much to ask but, I just want to check since… well if we all are friends technically, we got to all look out for each other.”</p>

 <p>Brook now asked, Sans which can tell gave Sans a moment to think of a way to answer that, surely an unexpected question of sorts for him but whos to blame a bit of curiosity and concern for someone that's a friend? “It’s…” Sans paused for a moment thinking, before continuing after he sighed , “I am not stressed don’t worry, just as for the whole to part, it’s a long story.” Sans answered now which still left Brook worried for them despite it. “Well… If you do need to talk about it, I am here…” Brook reassured, not wanting to force anything upon them but make it clear that they don’t have to be afraid to say things, sure maybe they all aren’t too close but it doesn’t stop Brook from giving them at least a space for if they do need to talk about anything. “Hm… Thanks Brook.” Sans gave a small smile to Brook upon hearing it before hearing now a crash from somewhere, who knows what crashes are those now but quickly Brook and Sans got ready for whatever it was as they slowly went over to where the results of the sound was. Slowly taking turns around some the halls and hearing another crash as they went really just made this a wonder on what it could even be, before slowly when they found the room it’s in, they slowly opened the door and peeked inside, seeing then a lot of COTS having been knocked right out and only began to fade away like usual before seeing a scythe go into another COTS that hit the wall and vanished, Jevil clearly is here judging by how the scythe looks after all. Which manic laughter followed afterwards from in the room, which Sans opened the door more to see what's going on to see Jevil ready to attack someone who was cowering in fear at Jevil seeing them move into one of the COTS that were yet taking a slower time to fade away which this someone looked like a COTS as well but it’s clear it had no intention of harm, in fact to Brook it looks far to familiar. Isn’t that the same COTS from all those other times it’s been around? Which yet quickly made her open the door fully to go in and stop Jevil. “JEVIL WAIT! NO!” Brook shouted, quickly going to Jevil to stop the scythe from swinging which luckily she stopped it before it could fully hit her as Jevil was surprised by Brook interfering as still tried to attack with it but yet Brook kept it far away still from this COTS. “COME ON! LET ME,ME KILL IT!” Jevil grew annoyed still trying to swing at it but Sans ended up coming by to help a bit. “This COTS helped save me and the others earlier! We don’t need to hurt this one..” Brook explained which Jevil seemed more confused while Sans at the same time was confused but yet seemed to understand now though why Brook was stepping in to stop Jevil and decided to help explain it to Jevil in more terms he could get. “So it means they aren’t bad and just misunderstood as such.” Sans added, which Jevil seemed to understand what it meant now just taking the scythe away then and making it vanish though appeared disappointed they couldn’t get the chance to attack this COTS then. Brook now looked to the COTS who was still cowering in fear at them all but yet now appeared almost confused by them as if trying to understand why they got saved at all. </p>

<p>“It's okay… You can go ahead and go somewhere safe now, okay?...” Brook went a bit down to there level to reassure this COTS who looked back at them, seeing them study Brook checking around them to figure them out and tilting their head in a curious confusion before seeming to quickly get up now and dashed away going through the wall like how a shadow hitting into it and fading away into nothing, unknown where they ran off to now. Jevil stood there disappointed they couldn't get to attack it as Sans watched it leave then looked to Brook who got up now, dusting herself off. “That was friendly of you to do.” Sans spoke up which yet Brook looked over as Jevil did too but he seemed annoyed. “WE STILL COULD'VE, COULD'VE ATTACKED THEM! WHAT IF, IF THEY ARE PLAYING INNOCENT, INNOCENT!” Jevil complained which Sans was thinking of a way to respond but Brook decided to do the talking for them. “Judging by the behavior, They seemed harmless and more so scared like how others have been about all of this going on. I'm sure though Jevil if they were going to do anything you would've been able to stop them right away whenever they tried to attack! Now, how about we go back to the rest? Wouldn't want them to worry where we are” Brook went on to explain before bringing up the offer to go back to the two which Jevil seemed to understand that now upon hearing it and agreed in doing so as Sans was surely not expecting Brook to be able to convince Jevil otherwise but yet nodded to agree on heading back now, wouldn't want the rest to worry after all. </p>

<p>Which the three then began to all leave the room and figure there way right back to the rest, Brook seeming to mostly remember the way there perhaps because of using the trick Bendy told her before on how to do so which yet does help in this case, which as they went seemed Jevil was getting eager now to ask questions on everything as they went. “I DON’T GET, GET IT WITH THOSE PEOPLE ANYWAY,ANYWAY! WHY ALL THIS STUFF,STUFF ON SCREAMS AND ESCAPING, ESCAPING? NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE,SENSE!” Jevil complained, seeming to point out about what he has heard which clues to when abouts he has left running off to somewhere during that point, which yet Sans decided to do the explaining. “If you stayed to listen you would’ve heard them say they did this stuff within reason, just doing it to survive to imagine, fighting for the ones you care about so they wouldn’t have to deal with stuff like this. At least, that's what I understood from that. Even though their methods about going with it aren’t exactly the greatest.” Sans explained, just speaking on even how he viewed the whole situation which left Jevil thinking due to it, able to tell Jevil either can’t get it and is trying to or maybe does get it but has to process it to fully understand, which whose to blame him for that, which as they began heading back Brook had to stop due to seeing something ahead that yet could very well be dangerous or not, it’s hard to tell due to how far it is though which made Jevil and Sans look as well, Jevil quickly readying to fight upon seeing it as a grin grew on there face in excitement they get to fight again while Sans more so just prepared but wasn’t going to initiate anything yet in case if it is harmless or not. Brook got a bit ready as can see this person at the end of the hall standing there, looking away before they went down and picked up something fiddling around with it before seeming to put it on their face? Before looking to see that they put on a mask and yet, this person is familiar, oh no, Clubtacka. Clubtacka then yelled out “THERE YOU ARE!” Before quickly Clubtacka began charging down the hall at them but Jevil jumped right to in front of Brook and Sans quickly spun their scythe to hit away the rapid swings of there club trying to get them through this defense Jevil had put up. This allowed for Sans to step in and quickly summon some bones to knock Clubtacka far away now from where they are leaving some distance between the three and Clubtacka. </p>

<p>Brook began to quickly lead the way back which Jevil and Sans began to follow once ensuring Clubtacka couldn’t charge right away back, quickly making turns after turns but can hear Clubtacka approaching due to there angered yell and bashing there club into some the walls whenever they turned, this isn’t good they got to all figure some way to get Clubtacka off their tail here. Can see how quickly Jevil was throwing different card suits at them to see if they could trip them up but yet wasn’t working while Sans summoned bones to help out but Clubtacka was dodging each one getting closer and closer to them readying to swing. Jevil quickly summoned there scythe to ready to swing it off, but Brook quickly took it to slide on by while Sans blocked the swing for them but right when Clubtacka readied to swing again Brook quickly struck them from behind with the scythe hitting them into one the walls before quickly catching up to where the rest are to keep going forwards which while she gave Jevil the scythe back they began to cheer right away. “HAHA! THAT WAS AWESOME,AWESOME! SO SNEAKY,SNEAKY OF AN ATTACK I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT,THOUGH OF!” Jevil cheered Brook for coming up with such an idea like that which Brook gave a smile upon hearing it while quickly making sure they all were going the correct way now as can hear Clubtacka once again was readying to catch up right to them again. </p>

<p>Which the rest quickly went onward until when turning one the corners quickly stopped seeing Ezose was there, putting there hand out as if to ready a magic attack but can tell they had a look that said ‘sorry’ as they did, quickly they tried to go some other way but they were all backed into a corner since Clubtacka was blocking one the other ways that is who they were trying to get away from. Quickly Jevil readied his scythe and did his best to stand in front of both Brook and Sans as if to almost protect them both while grinning ready to fight whenever they are allowed to. Clubtacka then whistled once piecing together what could go on causing multiple COTS to appear behind them and Ezose as if to act as backup, which yet clearly said how this won’t be too easy now because of that, there has to be another way out of this. “NOW!” said a familiar voice shouting from behind Clubtacka seeming them quickly bash them away seeing it was Bendy with Sonic soon after dealing with the COTS that's around where Clubtacka is to help Beny out while on Ezose’s end how Baldi quickly pulled them back allowing Mugman to step onward and used this can of soda Baldi has used before one time and sprayed any of the COTS and Ezose with it to cause the magic to go away and makes all the COTS be further away along with it, which soon later can see Sonic and Bendy went by Baldi and Mugman to get those COTS handled with quickly like they did with the ones near Clubtacka, who was quick to having getting back up ready to charge at them but Sans quickly summoned bones to block there way that Clubtacka ran right into and fell back due to it. </p>

<p>“HAH!” Jevil laughed while going over to where the bones blocked Clubtacka as if to ensure they won’t try breaking through that which yet Sans and Brook looked to see Bendy, Baldi and Mugman coming back over seeing Ezose was stuck once again in some kind of gum trap now for the time being. “Thanks guys, but, shouldn’t you guys be back watching on Stiex and Nuqx? What happened?” Brook asked after thanking them which can tell they did get an answer for this that seems pretty important. “Well, we were until then Clubtacka seemed to swing by to interrupt them, causing Stiex to have to flee to who knows where with this portal stuff and Nuqx had to be dragged away by Clubtacka afterwards saying something about needing them for something, which it’s clear they aren’t here so wherever she put Nuqx we have to find them and fast since judging by the sounds of this plan it isn’t good.” Bendy explained for them, looking to where Clubtacka is who seemed to start breaking the bones to try and get through but Jevil kept blocking it with card suits to fix the wall which Jevil was entertained by seeing how annoyed Clubtacka got each time they tried. “Which is clear, we better get searching fast while we can! But what spots could there possibly even be now??” Sonic made it clear that they should at least try to find Nuqx fast and soon that is for sure which Baldi seems to have thought up a possibility. </p>

<p>“Perhaps what we can do is go to the upper level, just would need a way up” Baldi spoke up while everyone looked to Baldi, there's another level? That surely is something nobody else here knew but yet it’s a fair idea. “So we just need to get there through like a pair of stairs or-” “The upper area is off limits usually, the only way up there is if we could either fly our way up or climb  it.” Baldi was quick to answer why they all never would have thought of there being another floor since it seems to be off limits, well that answers that but it’s no wonder Baldi thought of Nuqx perhaps being there by chance at all. “Alright, then we can take one of my blasters up, simple as that.” Sans added an answer to the idea which everyone agreed on upon hearing it, but yet can then hear the angry yells of Clubtacka who was not just annoyed by Jevil constantly blocking them but also seemed to be annoyed about the plan they are hearing. “NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE NOT DOING ANY OF THIS! HOW ABOUT YOU GET OVER HERE AND LEMME-” “OHHH BOO HOO,HOO! COME ON,ON! LET'S GET SOME MORE ACTION,ACTION THAN THIS!” Jevil interrupted Clubtacka while turning to the rest with a grin while he summoned their scythe to show they are ready, which does feel like Jevil is listening to them all more just by how he is, which is good really. “...Should we let mister Ezose guy go?” Mugman asked, which caused everyone to look to him, seeing how he was standing nearby Ezose who was just watching but looked to Mugman upon hearing this. </p>

<p>“Woah, woah, woah! Why would we do that?” “Yeah! They literally have caused some problems here!” Bendy spoke up which Sonic added in agreement to it to speak up everyone's confusion about why Mugman thinks on doing so. “Because by now he could’ve hit us with some magic but didn’t! Which I don’t think you’re too bad of a person too, right Ezose?” Mugman looked up to Ezose with a gentle smile which made Ezose a little surprised to see such a reaction like that coming from- well- anyone to what he yet did even to them here. “...Well-” “EZOSE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STANDING THERE AND DO YOUR JOB OR I’LL-” Clubtacka interrupted Ezose but due to it she got hit with some suits from the wall to interrupt her which angered Clubtacka more while Jevil laughed making sure that part of the wall is blocked again. “Well, Mugman makes a clear point especially with this here. I don’t see why not then.” Baldi agreed, looking to Ezose who gave a nod now in understanding. “I promise I won’t do anything then.” Ezose spoke up which the group looked to each other and came to agreement, seeing Baldi go over and free Ezose fully now from the gum trap, once Baldi did, Ezose stepped to the side to let the others go onward down that hallway, which the group all agreed, quickly going by, while Mugman took a moment to wave Ezose by while Jevil mainly was distracted making fun of Clubtacka before hearing the rest call for him to come on and began to do so now, which Ezose watched them all go staying where he was, before hearing Clubtacka now break through the magic as he turned to look. “Why didn’t- YOU STOP THEM!? Are you fucking dumb?? If those guys get any info from the rest, then our group is dead! EVEN I CAN GET THAT WHY CAN’T YOU!??” Clubtacka shouted at Ezose while they prepared their club to fight. “...I think, for what I have as an answer, will be best for you to learn later.” Ezose answered which Clubtacka only got more angry hearing this, raising their club and…</p>

<h5>Why would you go and do that? </h5>
<h5>It’s for the safety of the rest is why</h5>
<h5>But we could all die  if you tried</h5>
<h5>That's why I'm going alone  he replied. </h5>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Creatures Mystery</h2>

<p>The three, Brook,Sans and Bendy, walked onwards back to town with Sans’s lead for he was the most familiar with where to go due to this being his universe as said a few times before, gets one to really see the area around that was all so snowy with pine trees and often those trees with a dark brown bark to them with a rough texture to them despite looking smooth in some way being different from how the fluffy snow feels, somewhat lost in this large forest that hopefully the path they’re on will lead them to the town that one may have saw for a brief amount of time to see it was under attack of those creatures from the various times before, what are those creatures anyways? Quite the question that begged her own mind for an answer, maybe even the other two had the same wonder, but then again may be the least of concerns to them aside from causing the danger that’s around. But maybe even some knowledge on what these beings are or what they do may help, but before she can speak up about such a thing, Bendy spoke up first for a different thing. “So why are you so moody anyways Sans? Like yeah I get the universes are in danger but can you at least cheer up a little??” Once Bendy said that, Sans looked over giving a bit of a look that was of both confusion and a sign of some judgment of some kind along with it before he spoke back to that remark. “That’s because I am not like you for this, even so, it’s all quite dangerous anyway. It's best to remain serious or crack a ‘punny’ joke here and there.” </p>

<p>Hearing a joke like that was quite funny even though it is yet meant to be a serious moment of sorts, which yet Bendy had yet a response ready for that even hearing such a joke like that. “Ohh, did I just hear yeah crack a joke just now? Is the skeleton coming out of that creepy closet they’re said to be in?” Bendy tried to go over and nudge Sans to try and encourage it, but Sans moved away, giving a stop motion with there hand to show to not try that, which Bendy gave a confused look of sorts to such an action but did end up listening anyways not trying to now, but caused Bendy to talk again. “Come on, what’s with the mood? Come on, things should be alright! Got Brook here to even help us figure this all out like the fact she managed to find that guy and learn an idea for where a way to the cause could be is spectacular if you ask me! So despite this being terrifying, how about a little smile since it’s all gonna be over hopefully soon!” Sans seemed to take a moment to think of what Bendy had said, thinking and then said “I’ll think about it.” before he continued to walk onwards to lead the way back to town. Bendy sighed at this, slowing down to walk beside Brook now, looking over with a look of shame on there face or disappointment, thinking he may have failed to convince him and seems to understand why in some sense for it that could be what’s causing that feeling of he has failed and may not succeed for that, which Brook took a moment, before moving more closer to walk closer beside Bendy, which Bendy noticed and gave a small smile seeing Brook do this as a way of comfort. </p>

<p>“Well, Hopefully this journey gets easier overtime, wouldn't you say?” Bendy spoke up, looking at Brook to see Brook have a confused look of some kind hearing that, why yes it would be nice for it too, but yet that could have many meanings for what way for it too. “What do you mean by that, Bendy?” “Well, Just that this whole journey is simple and easy… even a hope we all grow close if you ask me, cause come on, a chance to make friends in some way like this is quite amazing if you ask me to have a chance like this.” Bendy smiled for a moment looking ahead as if having a hope for it but yet it’s like it faded and grew weak along with the smile that faded with it into a frown, looking down to the ground which made Brook grow worried. “So you’re unsure if it’s all going to be like that even in the friends category?.” “YES! EXACTLY THAT! Yeah… that. But-” Bendy seemed to try to think the words but couldn’t, looking over at Brook with some hope for if she got any. “You fear there will be failure?... Yet even though you're not failing since you got me as a friend already, I’m sure anyone else we meet or know will come around over time. Patience is like waiting for your favorite season to roll around or your birthday to roll around too which turns out to be great once it happens!” Brook smiled at Bendy, moving a bit closer to cheer Bendy up who stared for a moment then he smiled there eyes lighting up with that happiness and hope once again upon those words, till was interrupted by Sans all so suddenly. “We’re almost in town now.” “Already?? Sheesh time flies when you're chatting!” Bendy responded, that smile remaining but instead of looking ahead looked at Brook again, which Brook did back, giving a small smile back before Bendy seemed to say a “Thank you” till he looked away, and began to continue onward now ready for whatever may happen when they are at this town now, which Brook prepared to for who knows what may happen being here. </p>

<p>Upon arriving there, they were able to witness the town to be yet more in such disaster, portals opened all across the skies and even all around the ground or attached on to buildings around with more of those creatures spilling out from them and wrecking havoc across the town throwing anything it can rip out from the ground or on buildings that go flying across further out into the unknown of the forests around, some going through buildings without even needing to use the door fading like a shadow when a light is shine directly on it to enter the building to only throw any furniture it can find out any of the windows there or right out the doors as far as they could, which to say it’s lucky there is no sign of any other people here or to think these creatures may try attacking them and throwing them as far as they could like they are for anything they can get hold of that can be possible to throw. Which the three, seeing this remained hidden, watching the havoc and scanning around for if there is a sign of anything that could be a clue to who may be causing this, but none to be seen except portals coming and going when something falls into one to make it disappear but another shows to keep the same number it is meant to be at, making it clear this may be a challenge then to stop this portal madness. </p>

<p>“Hmm, it doesn't appear there is any indication of who could be causing this, but it seems there are a lot of portals here though.” Sans proclaimed, studying everything and thinking if there is anything that they could do to find a clue of someone being here. “There surely are thousands of them if you ask me! Where even are these things coming from!?? What even are they?? Because these creatures look odd versus the ones back in my universe, like they kinda just-” “Don’t exist?” Brook answered for Bendy who went on about it, which caused Bendy to look over with a smile then nodding. “Yeah! But they do though! Which is odd, but hey they at least are easy to handle!” “Uhh- you sure on that” Sans asked, seeming to keep his focus on something in the town which caused the other two to look at Sans in confusion. “Sannns- When people say stuff like that usually it means something- what is it?” Bendy asked with a look of concern that made Sans point to something to the town, which caused the two to look and be left in silence. What was yet to be seen further into town that was shuffling it’s massive feet along through the snow causing a massive pile each time to form doing so, it’s massive hands near close to the ground during it but were clawed and ready to attack, able to look high up to the top of it to see it appeared different seeming to have horns that mixed in with it, looking as though a massive version of those creatures one has been dealing with looking as massive as a house. </p>

<p>This left everyone to yet be speechless seeing such a being that luckily wont see them while in hiding but thank goodness to Sans to notice it or who knows what could’ve happened if they weren’t aware of it, which then again it was very easy to notice it for how massive it is. “What in the inky lord's name is that…” Bendy said, speechless at the very sight of this massive being that is in the town they aren’t far from. “Appears as though it’s a stronger version of the rest, which means there seems to be different kinds then if this is the same kind of creature we’ve been seeing.” Sans responded, looking at it quite surprised to see such a thing as well, but yet studied it to see if he can get the idea of what exactly this large creature is. Brook was silent, studying the creature, seeing how tall and massive this creature was, something about it, how was this possible? For there to be- well, a being that can be this giant that makes one wonder if there even is anything larger than this. <em>Destruction, Creation… the tallest of the talls, gods…</em></p>

<p>“Well what are we going to do now?? This is like some large roadblock here to even figuring out what could be causing all this!” Bendy claimed, looking at the other two in hopes one of them had any ideas at all for something like this. Brook shook her head no at that for no idea could come to mind currently even for this, but Sans seemed to be studying the area around as if to try and get an idea of it all, which caused Brook and Bendy to look at Sans in confusion, then at one another for both had the same wonder for what he is doing or if he even heard the question as well. Till then Sans looked over at the two thinking of what to say for a moment before speaking up now as if to answer Bendy’s question. “There are some ways we could get by this actually, but that’s if we all work together though.” Sans spoke up that made Bendy and Brook look at one another then at Sans, which both seemed to speak up at the same time. “Alright! What’s the plan?” This caused both Bendy and Brook to look at one another due to saying it at the same time which was not suspected to even happen, that caused Sans to look at the two in at first some small confusion but then went back to that focused look now. </p>

<p>“Alright, listen closely for this one since I am going to need your two’s help for most of this one...” Sans seemed to then go on about a few plans that can be done, both listening in closely to each detail making sure to memorize each one to prepare for this, don’t want to screw it up now in any way to risk being in danger, since it isn’t a video game after all they can’t come back if so. Once the plan was figured out, it was time to put it to action, first step: distraction. Brook, studied a spot where some of these creatures gathered, studying the spot while the other two followed behind and encouraged Brook to step out quietly, which took her a moment to step out carefully, studying around at all of them taking a moment then stepped out, seeing all the creatures not see or hear her at all, taking a moment, looking over seeing Bendy whisper “Whistle! That’ll get their attention” which Brook looked, then looked back, taking a moment thinking before just clapping her hands together to be loud enough to get their attention instead which did indeed work, causing all of them to look over quickly staring at her, before suddenly all began charging at her. </p>

<h5>Now</h5>

<p>Suddenly she quickly moved to the side all charging right at one another and hit into the tree that suddenly bones were trapped around them all making a cage to keep the creatures all locked in there, which then Bendy shouted in excitement seeing it “THAT WAS AWESOME BROOK! IT WAS LIKE A SCENE IN A-” “Quiet down Bendy! Don’t want any more of those creatures hearing us.” Sans said, hushing Bendy from yelling all so loudly they don’t want to risk that larger creature hearing them or having any other of the creatures make it come over to go after them, otherwise that would be such a challenge to get by. The three continued onward, making there way quietly by, checking abouts to be sure there still is no more of those creatures around having ways to work around it, rather it be distract and trap, take a shortcut around and so on, till they reached a point where there seemed to be multiple of them crowded together in a spot not far from the library like a spot they all seem to be hanging out at for the spot to the side, which to think could be easy to get by, but for the amount is any of them could see them go by, so they all studied it, thinking of what could or couldn’t be done. “Huh, can’t think of any methods around this one currently, any you have in mind for these creatures?” Sans asked, looking at Brook and Bendy, Brook studied it all but couldn’t think anything currently then looked at Bendy hoping for an idea which Bendy was studying it all thinking, then seemed to look at the two now quickly. “These creatures behave similar to something I know, So to think if I am right this is the time where they would all gather around for something or to do something, in a matter of time then they are going to all separate then! Unless it’s-” </p>

<p>Right when Bendy said that, suddenly all the creatures started to charge at one another and attack at the other, biting and trying to tear anything they could on the other, loud roars and other animalistic noises that can be heard from each creature that battled in such a violent manner.“Was that something along with what you were going to say?” “No, No it actually wasn’t but that can be at times another thing except never like this-” Bendy responded to what Brook had asked, which made Sans seem to then begin to lead the way now, speaking up with a “come on, before it gets worse” which the two began to follow, Brook looking at the crowd that is there fighting, except saw one there looking odd from the rest, looking like they wore something of darkness too looking quite scarf like, and had weird ear like horns that were lowered looking quite like the other ones there, watching it flee, leaving questions to who or what that was that causes more mysteries on the creatures before being pulled on the arm to come along by Bendy who shouted a bit a “Hey! Come on Brook! Don’t want you in that since you seem to be their favorite target!” which once said caused Brook to come along quickly so that won't be any outcome that happens. BG-45</p>

<p>Well, as an outcome that wished to never happen, feels like the outcome that was near close to happening cause moving aside heard one the creatures get thrown to right in the line of sight of the three who saw them and roared loudly, causing Sans and Bendy nearly say “oh sh-” before quickly just get interrupted by Brook yelling a “RUN!” that caused them to stop what they’re saying and the three quickly run while the creature began to chase after them roaring loudly while caused other ones to follow, causing Brook to look back then heard a much louder roar like noise looking to see it seems to have alarmed the larger creature seeming to come over to check, which caused Brook to look at the other two worried, which Bendy seemed to notice it to then looked at Brook that seemed he was able to tell how Brook was feeling at this moment, causing him to quickly end up thinking fast, grabbing Brook’s hand for what he can reach then Sans by the hood making a quick turn and suddenly there was a pitch darkness before light shined again and all tumbled to the ground hitting it but luckily there was a carpet on the ground otherwise it would’ve yet hurt some more, the three groaning a bit in pain and exhaustion from all that running, before it took a moment before Bendy spoke up “Oh inky hell, I didn’t think that was going to work but it did- is everyone alright??” </p>

<p>“Y-yeah- I am- but just-” before Brook could finish, the three heard a loud roar from outside as if it had made its way here but then heard it moving away though as if saw it all as just some game the creatures were playing, which hearing it go was yet very relieving who knew a sound of something walking away can even give a feeling like that. “Well, Bendy, you never said you can do that.” Sans spoke up now, looking over at Bendy while laid on the ground tired out from that whole thing that happened, which Bendy looked over hearing him say that giving a confused look. “Wait, I didn't tell you I can do that?? Sheesh Can’t believe I never said, well you know now!” Bendy spoke up, sitting up now and taking a moment to settle down though for doesn’t want to get up right away now, looking over at the other two as if making sure they both are okay, even at Brook since he seemed to see and figure how it was for Brook, which was, well for her pretty scary, so much happening, so much danger, it was like death was grinning while watching it all in the palm of it’s massive clawed hand, but was escaped and such a swift way all cause of Bendy, which made her take a moment before spoke up. “Thank you, Bendy. Who knows if- we’ll be alive because of that…” Bendy seemed to turn to look hearing Brook say that, staring for a moment then smiling at them a small yet tired out smile. </p>

<p>“You’re welcome Brook… couldn’t leave you two there and yet I was all hoping that will work anyhow to save you both and not just me.” Bendy spoke up, looking at Brook then at Sans feeling happy to succeed in such a way to rescue the both of them from all that being able to yet be safe now from such a thing, rather the three could’ve been squished like bugs to think or chewed up from those creatures. “Well, aside from that save now, where are we even going to go now with all those creatures outside of here?” Sans asked, taking a moment to stand up despite being probably the most tired out versus the two from it especially for using magic to even think, looking around to see if there could be any exits around the place they’re in, which Bendy watched as he did, getting up to, checking around while spoke up, “Good question there- unless I do that wall thing again but that may lead us to the open even- SHEESH- It’s difficult with these weird fully black odd acting creatures being everywhere when we could’ve been close to figuring who’s causing this!” “Well not everything works in anyone’s favor now, so don’t suspect it all to remain good.” Sans spoke up to what Bendy said which made Bendy look over thinking of what Sans said and thought on keeping what he said in mind now. </p>

<p>During this Brook watched them try to think some ideas while she got up, thinking on what’s been said and wished upon, while yet also left with wonders upon a few things again, the creatures to be specific, maybe if there could be a way found to simply just maybe understand these things and figure there behaviors, it could be easier to get by them for specific things, which lucky for being in a library there could be a book on it. Brook began searching around the place while hearing the other two talk about what seems like plans and on what to do and not do and whose plan is better than the others along with it. “COME ON!! HOW COME WE CAN’T JUST GO INTO A PORTAL FOR WHAT IF THE ENEMY IS THERE??” “And risk going into the wrong one to be only further from our goal? Bendy for what that DDraig guy has said being one the strangest I seen from others who fell here aside from you, this could be a lead, why would you want to even do so anyways?” Sans asked when Bendy shouted that, which caused Bendy to nervously sweat a bit at that, “WELL JUST- Maybe it can help so..” Sans looked at Bendy in confusion with a mix of worry hearing him say that, suspecting more that has some other meaning that’s unknown to him, which made Brook listen in curiously before felt something crawl on her hand quickly looking over being startled to see it was a spider that fled quickly off and further away into the bookcase she was near, looking to see a book that was there looking old as ever that made her pull it out and study it. </p>

<p>The Tale Of Shadows is what was read upon it, which she opened to the front, then flipped through observing each page then once saw quite right away an image of those creatures seen that was placed within it, she smiled at that and looked over at the other two who kept talking. “Sans, Bendy! I think I found something that could help us figure out what these creatures are!” Brook spoke up loud enough to stop the two from talking and looked over, which right when Bendy heard it he smiled at that, going over to check the book out right away with Brook, “Wow! Good find Brook! Who knew this universe has a book right here on them! That must mean they could be from this universe!” Bendy exclaimed, opening the book and going through the pages, till Sans spoke up while coming over, “No. We have nothing like those things out there here, they behave much more different from all the other monsters down here, Nor anyone can create anything like that along with it let alone that many.” Hearing that made Bendy frown for that not being the answer, though looked at the book again thinking and going through it, attempting to read as quick as he could now as if to explain for them, till Brook seemed to give it a quick read and spoke up “Huh, so they’re called COTS, being a short form for Creatures Of The Shadows, Often behaving like a tall shadowy animal but some appear to be close to behaving like a person while appearing to look like a messed up human like shadow.” </p>

<p>Once Brook has said what she has read, Bendy looked over not suspecting her to be able to read all that quite quickly, then smiled, “Well quite impressive for you to read that quick now! Alright so what we are dealing with is these COTS things! Huh, interesting how it says they can look human but they don’t at all though if you asked me” Bendy claimed, studying the book and going through it, moving more near to where Brook is so Brook can read quickly what is there to figure what it is about, which she did, reading over what is all said able to understand what it discusses of and thinks for a simple way put what it is about before looking to Bendy and then Sans who waited to hear what’s to be said. “So according to the book, it talks of these creatures behaving like animals that attack and fight and some are human like able to talk the rare ones and be more aware of things aside from the rest who wouldn’t care usually, aside from that though it then talks of how they often attack anyone who seems to be holding something called íroesite or in other words a gem because of it giving them power, then it goes on about forms and-” “Wait- Wait- Is that why they are targeting Brook?” Bendy asked that caused the other two to look in confusion hearing Bendy ask that, what does he mean is a wonder. </p>

<p>“What do you mean Bendy?” Sans asked, giving a look of doubt and yet some concern, which Bendy then seemed to get hold of a part of Brook’s necklace and held it up and pointed to the lapis lazuli colored stone that’s a part of it dangling at the end. “This! Brook has worn it all those times when around those creatures and often targeted for her cause of it, what if this is the reason why!” “Well then why not stop wearing it so they all stop doing so?” Sans asked once Bendy explained, which Brook looked over hearing that, holding onto the necklace now and looking at it now thinking of what to say, which right when about to speak up Bendy did before her. “WOAH WOAH WOAH- NO! SHE IS NOT! THAT WAS A GIFT SHE WAS GIVEN! YOU CAN’T JUST TAKE AWAY SOMETHING SPECIAL TO HER! RATHER IT MAY RISK HER DANGER OR NOT SHE CAN WEAR IT IF SHE WANTS TO! And if it seems like such a hassle then to watch her due to such a thing then I will be the one doing so then that way it isn’t an issue!” Due to Bendy seeming to yell about all this made Sans go silent, quite stunned to speak even for Bendy to say all that, he can’t really argue with it surely does seem. </p>

<p>When Sans then seemed to try and speak up back to it, suddenly heard a startled scream that was not from any of them, sounding like it came from outside, which made the three look over to where it was heard, peeking out from the window to look outside while tried to be hidden in some way so none of those now learned to be called COTS can see them, which what they saw right away what seems to be a portal that then forms right in the path of this town before there eyes and then a hand wearing what seems like fingerless gloves comes out from it first.</p>

<h5>It's a pain to deal with such things sometimes…</h5>
<h5>Even the ones that defend others along with it,</h5>
<h5>Oh,  but things were often so unfortunate for him. </h5>

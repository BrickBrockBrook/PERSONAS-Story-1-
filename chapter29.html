<h2>Chapter 29. Never let go</h2>

<p>Does it go on forever in these halls? Do the twist and turns ever end or the ups and downs leaving only a sepia-toned maze to be lost in? It sometimes feels they’re all walking through a sketch with a line held down on paper drawing a path they following going random directions, the movements a steady pace that soon eventually they all know it’s got to end somewhere, there's got to be a destination, a destination they are reaching all through the assist of a little small thorn unknown how Bendy got it, but, he kept hold of it and studied it closely to know where it goes as Brook walked beside them observing how it moved in such strange ways, which starts to beg the question about it all now. “So… How did you get that thorn anyway?” Brook asked which caused Bendy's attention to avert to Brook upon hearing it. “Well, when it was Me, Jevil and Sans we tried to stop Clubtacka and when they escaped through a portal I managed to keep it open but this-vine of sorts attacked me and left a thorn in the process. Though it does leave a wonder what the vine belonged to since we haven’t encountered anyone with vines!” Bendy then started to question once answering the question which was quick to have Sonic zoom beside them overhearing. “OH! OH! What off is actually not a person and it's this giant evil plant creature they have as a pet???” Sonic theorized leaving the rest to think if that's the case.</p> 

<p>“Eh, it still is likely it could’ve been a person, after all the movements looked more determined, animals often need more time to think of the actions before going into action.” Sans answered with a more likely possibility which leaves everyone thinking still, but yet can see Baldi has thought up something about it all it seems. “It does seem likely to belong to a person for what I am getting. Or perhaps something latched upon a person, if as of currently the thorn is behaving like it wants to go back, its movements and behavior are similar to something wanting to go back to an owner of it. Meaning once we do succeed in reaching the destination, it’s a likely possibility of having to be careful.”  Baldi explained his thought process which yet seems like the logical explanation here. Though Mugman then spoke up with a little bit of curiosity. “Who is this person though?..” Mugman asked, which left everyone thinking about that now. “DUH! It’s got to be the boss of all of this!” Sonic spoke up, but then Baldi chimed in “Well, we aren’t sure how many are EXACTLY in this group.” Luckily Sans, Bendy and Brook already had some idea how many there are. “Well lets see, there was DDraig and Balaur” “Then there's Alovo and Uvilein” Sans added to what Bendy said. “Then there was Solgo and Luradis” Brook also added. “Then we’ve seen Nuqx, Ezose and Clubtacka.” Bendy continued it but yet can tell there was a pause for thinking now. “I guess we count Stiex? Then there is the boss… Storsi.” Brook added the last bit of what can be remembered making everyone be left to think now on that. “Eleven in total. For just members, if not counting the boss, it would be Ten.” Baldi answered which made Sonic pause hearing that and start to quietly count to check if it is eleven then soon after nodded in agreement once having checked it. That’s when Bendy snapped his fingers once remembering something and looked to the rest. </p>

<p>“That’s it! It has to be the boss then! Since that Luradis person didn’t they say the boss has something to do with thorns??” Bendy spoke on his realization which yet left everyone thinking. “Right! That means this thorn here likely belongs to the boss.” Brook responded by studying the thorn that kept leading the group onwards. “Hey guys?.” Sans spoke up, causing everyone to pause and look over. “Where's Jevil? He was here a moment ago then-""AHAHAHAHA! I GOT IT, I GOT ITTTT!” Sans was interrupted from Jevil who sounded further ahead but- where further ahead? Then can see he dropped down from an opening on the ceiling holding onto a vine with thorns that was above there being wrapped around it like its a rope coming from somewhere, seeing how Jevil gave an excited wave once seeing the rest before the vine fell out from somewhere up there and made Jevil and it drop to the ground together. Sans went over helping Jevil back up while Sonic was quick to pick up the vine and held it up for everyone else to see. “Where on earth did he get this??” “I FOUND IT, IT EMERGING OUT ONE,ONE THE PORTALS THAT CLOSED SOON AFTER,AFTER!” Jevil said proudly, causing the rest to look to Jevil wanting to know more about what he meant by it came from a portal, could it possibly be the very portal they are looking for? “Jevil, you are gonna need to explain more.” Bendy spoke up which Jevil grinned more hearing that. “SIMPLE,SIMPLE! SAW IT,IT EMERGE, THEN IT TRIED TO ATTACK, ATTACK! SO I HAVE SLICED,SLICED IT ALL UP,UP AND NOWWW WE GOT ONE THE VINE PIECES,PIECES!” Jevil spoke with such joy at the idea of attacking something violently, but it should mean at least this part of the vine that could belong to it shouldn’t attack, right? It at least gives them a better look at what it is that they’re looking for. “WOAH, WOAH! GUYS??” “Hang on Sonic. Jevil, are you sure this could be the same exact vine? Look I know it’s hard to tell color in a place like this but this could be a vine from anywhere! I mean you’ve seen all the portals getting here right!? It’s far more than likely it will be that versus the crazy chance of it being the same vine and thorns that connect to this thorn here!” </p>

<p>Bendy interrupted Sonic, which leaded to Brook to glance over while the rest listened in only to notice the vine was wrapping around Sonic trying to attack them and all, quickly making Brook go over and try to help free Sonic from it who was also trying to fight it off but yet kept growing larger the vine, this isn’t a good situation. “OH PLEASEEE! I’M SURE, SURE IT'S THE SAME VINE,VINE! I MEAN LOOKIE IT,IT!” Jevil gestured to the chaos going on, which Bendy glanced over for a second, looked back, then looked over again realizing what's going on causing everyone else to look to see the vine situation going on. Sans quickly helped knock the vine off Sonic which it tried to go over to Brook next but Baldi quickly held it down while Mugman shot part of its end, causing it to go still now. Then everyone stood around the vine to study it. It's hard to make out colors in a world like this of what it could possibly be, but the tints of the golds and blacks around everything gets could very well help match it up with something close. Bendy then held up the thorn to near the vine to see what happens, the thorn didn’t react to it for it seems it still could be leading them right to the portal but studying the colors it’s darker shades do quite match in some way, it is close perhaps very, but who's to know for certain when the base of the vine they yet do not got an example for? But, it does bring likely possibilities they could be belonging to the same thing. “SEEE???? I TOLD YOU,YOU!” Jevil proclaimed but yet the rest still gave him some looks of uncertainty. “Let's focus here. We should keep our guards up if things such as this are starting to crawl in, if Bendy says this place is already dangerous enough, then who knows what'll happen if more dangers appeared.” </p>

<p>Baldi spoke up, giving clear instructions on the task at hand as everyone quickly nodded before Bendy then began leading the way once again forwards through this place, To truly see it, everywhere sure is getting more dangerous by the second, they got to stop all of this, they have to in some way, which is simple, find the causes of these portals and defeat the leader, clear enough plan. They should be able to, they faced off several foes, they faced off some large creatures, ones that flew through the air, even foes with either great strength, knowledge or agility. Though the leader, they don’t even have a clue what they are capable of, They’d have to be stronger then all of them combined, which luckily they formed quite a large group to face them then if so. All with strength, knowledge, speed, creativity, strategies and a good form of defense. It’s quite interesting. It feels to put it into words such as that, almost like, it feels right for them each, something that makes sense in a way. The group continued onwards, watching there every step as the floors creaked below them but they marched on ready for any form of danger that could be ahead, the place felt eerie, quiet, like a looming dread is around, the feeling even behind each wall or floorboard is perhaps another hallway or another room perhaps a portal just locked on the other side, who knows to where but it’s not the one they yet search for, just by one little thorn it should get them there. It has to, otherwise would they all be wandering this place forever? Would they have to create a portal or travel through several? Or would it be game over like if this was all a video game? Who truly knows aside from it only is more clear they got to find this portal and fast. Suddenly a loud creak was heard from around, causing everyone to look amongst each other to see if any of them caused that, all keeping still in case. A moment of silence was around, a long pause, but yet not a sound from anywhere. “Well that was weird! Alright lets-” Then another loud creak interrupted Sonic from talking, confirming this wasn’t one any of them caused, something else is here. Something just above or perhaps below them, perhaps following, or listening, something potentially large. </p>

<p>Slowly can see Bendy lower himself to the ground more motioning everyone to follow his lead, each of them lowering more and doing small quiet steps onwards, trying to sneak away from the creaking above but yet as much distance as they made from the creak sound its like they hear it again just above them, something is following, something clearly large for how it sounds from above them its like its soon to sink in through the floor if they step in the wrong spot. “Run.” Bendy said quietly, causing the rest to look over in confusion. “RUN!” Bendy then shouted once realizing the rest didn’t understand suddenly there was a loud roar from above them, a hand smashing through the floor that appeared large and shadowy alike to a COTS but there was no time to study as the group began to run, hearing loud stomps from above them of something giving chase, smashing its hand through the floor trying to hit any of them but everyone kept swiftly dodging each one, seeing Sonic due to being ahead quickly slowed down to then force the hand to try and land at any spots that they were at so the group can get further ahead and not be at greater risk of danger. Even can hear Sonic taunting it of missing each time and to come and get them while he was swiftly dodging each attack, the group quickly then turned a corner to try and break free from the path it could be following along though yet it was still loud and close by, they have to get further down if they want to escape this creature. That’s when there was loud crashing coming from above seeing it breaking itself a way onto the level they are on seeing how large this creature is seeing it lower its head to see the white scribbly eye it had staring right upon them sending chills through the room, this is bad. </p>

<p>Quickly the group ran even faster hearing it roar chasing them down but they kept on staying further ahead quickly taking several turns to try and find some sort of way out of here to escape this what seems like a COTS after them. Quickly there was an opening down one the halls the group turned to and jumped down in running further ahead down the halls there is but it did not slow this COTS down hearing it tear through the floors behind them and continue to follow which due to that caused the roof above them to start to crack and make pieces of the roof fall down, causing the group to have to dodge those while they ran, this isn’t good. Quickly can see Jevil spun around while the group kept going ahead readying their scythe as if to attack this COTS which can see Sans noticed quick, seeing the COTS stop before them readying to slam there fist into Jevil to crush them which Jevil dodged quickly using it to climb up and slice at their eye but was swatted away before he could do much, about to slam into the wall but can see this blue magic went over around Jevil and quickly brought him away from another hit which Jevil looked around to try and figure who did to see Sans was the one to cause that. Which another punch was thrown by the COTS but quickly Sans used the magic to bring Jevil right back down to the ground which Jevil was able to break free from the magic, spinning to turn to look at the COTS with a large grin on his face, quickly charging at the COTS again which as it swung Jevil slid under summoning some suits aimed at the COTS, while summoning more once having slid behind it, signaling to Sans to do something similar, which Sans quickly started summoning some bones into the air while getting to its side which ass it tried to hit Sans he summoned a blaster that picked him up to go up high, dodging another swing while making it to the other side summoning more bones along the way before getting behind it. The COTS turned around to face them now to try and swing only to be greeted with several suits of sorts and bones ready to hit them from all sides, which Jevil looked to Sans offering his hand up for a fist bump, which Sans saw, doing a small shrug before fist bumping them which then caused all the suits and bones to hit right into this COTS breaking it down so much so that way its far weaker then how it was before, giving Jevil and Sans a chance to slide out from it and run to catch up with the rest now. Can hear the loud roars now far more distance as the group ran on reaching a spot that was a large opening that yet dropped down, another one of these it seems, but yet it looks it seems it can go up to who knows where, which can see Bendy hold up the thorn seeing it lead that they got to head up somehow, just a matter on how. </p>

<p>“Alright! This should be easy! Sans! Blaster us on up!” Sonic went over ready for Sans to summon it, but Sans didn’t, which made him look over confused seeing Sans looked tired out, probably used up a lot of energy trying to deal with the COTS back there, which sure if he had enough energy to summon one, would it really last them long enough to reach there? There has to be some other way. Quickly can see Jevil step on ahead summoning multiple of his scythes and stabbed them into the walls and get doing so to make a staircase going upwards, leading the way onwards as Sonic was the first to take a step in following, which then Baldi picked up Mugman so Mugman can rest on his shoulders taking the next steps, which soon after Sans did along with Bendy and Brook. Although it felt wobbly in some sense even really having to be precise on where they step to ensure they won’t fall, although that's the challenge, they all are making their way up despite it, seemingly Jevil was doing so with a lot of ease almost like they are just normal stairs to him. “Are we sure this is safe??” Mugman asked, staying close to Baldi while resting on their shoulders while Baldi was being precise with each step they took. “OHH OF COURSE, COURSE IT IS! SIMPLY JUST DON'T LOOK, LOOK DOWN AND RUN!” Jevil laughed as he had backed up to where they were then went right on farther ahead with ease continuing to make the staircase heading upwards. Taking each step it felt tough, it felt off, it felt you were all so high up relying on slim steps to get up to more safer ground, like you just went down an old basement and now you’re getting back up to the main house, it’s a wonder why even is there such a big opening here in a place like this? But then again, this place is always full of mysteries that the only person who could explain them is Bendy, which in fact… Maybe he could do a lot more explaining on certain things. </p>

<p>“...So why did you try to make a portal before all of this began?..” Brook spoke up causing everyone to listen in which made Bendy pay attention to the questions asked and think of how to begin, which he seemed to figure out what to say quite quickly. “Well… Look at this place. It’s practically colorless, it’s dangerous even before COTS came showing up everywhere, which due to well- findings books and things apparently all universes have on these things with the help of someone I knew who.. God who knows where they are now. It showed it is possible to make one and so I obviously tried, but I couldn’t figure out how to fuel it, nothing could give me the exact clear information. Only the clue of there is these gems that some use to fuel them, but, of course , no specification what gem.”  Bendy explained which caused everyone to slowly pause hearing that, a gem, a gem he says, unknown what but… This whole time one has been carrying that many COTS have gone after likely due to the reason of its power… Potentially the key to creating a portal in case if they fail to find this one, perhaps they can create one. Brook then went over to Bendy carefully, taking her necklace off and handing it to him, keeping a hand under it in case to ensure it won't fall. “Then hold onto this, in case anything happens ahead” Brook spoke up, which Bendy was quick to decline. “What?? No no, you hold onto it! Look, I will let you know if at any time I need it you can hand it over then, okay??” Bendy gently moved it back towards Brook who had no choice but to put the necklace back on now, which was when there was a sudden rumble around the place, everyone quickly going against the wall as it happened, studying around to see where it's coming from before it stopped leaving a silence to fill the air. </p>

<p>Then a deep groan rose up from what sounds it's below them in this deep dark pit they are above, then it was when they saw a white eye open up from below all scribbled like once again. It's back, and this time larger than ever. Causing everyone to quickly hurry up running up the scythes as Jevil kept on placing them even faster this time as the COTS below roars at them and seems to be climbing it's way up to them causing the place to shake and rumble each time one of its hands hit into the wall to pull itself upwards, making it hard to keep balance and focus due to it. The place did a harsh shook once again making Brook nearly fall but quickly Bendy caught hold of her pulling her right back up and keeping hold as they went up, both reaching up to Sans while Bendy lended his hand out to him which Sans got hold of allowing the three to go up together being able to keep a faster pace so in case if one of them slips can pull each other right back up. Then they reached up to Baldi and Mugman, Mugman trying to see if he can shoot this COTS back down while Baldi got them up but it was hard to aim due to the rumbles around, which yet Sans got hold of Baldi's hand to help out to keep them both balanced as they kept heading upwards, which can see Sonic and Jevil made it ahead to the spot, Jevil starting to throw scythes and suits down at the COTS to see if he can slow it down while Sonic ran back through the scythe stairs to help the rest getting hold of Baldi's hand to help bring them up to where they need to be,  though yet can hear a loud roar shaking the place harshly making the group hug the wall till it settled seeing then the COTS pace started to speed up to try and reach them oh great. Quickly everyone started going up the stairs as fast as they could though the COTS pace only got faster that only the bits of damage Mugman and Jevil are doing are the only help to ensure they get up, it wasn’t until the COTS broke the paths ahead causing the group to see it's going to reach up to them, this isn’t good. </p>

<p>Then quickly can notice Sans tighten his grip he had of some the rest, quickly running off dragging around with to off the stairs to above the pit where the COTS is, the summoning a blaster below them for them all to hold onto tightly, getting there balance as Sans aims the blaster at the COTS while Sonic reached for Jevil to bring them right over with getting hold of there hand once Jevil jumped over with, which then caused the blaster to then shoot fire raising them all upwards as it hits the COTS far past from it and far past the spot they were at till it turned direction to one the higher up openings and tossing them all in before the blaster disappeared leaving the group laying against the floor tired out from all that running and madness that yet happened. Though yet can notice Jevil was the first to get back up and went over to everyone to see them all tired out as he went over to the opening to check, surely the COTS now should be pushed much further back down to who knows where further down, though they better get moving before it reaches them if it has yet haven’t vanished yet. Jevil giggled seeing down and looked to the rest while starting to cheer in some way “NOW LOOKIE,LOOKIE THAT!! IT TOOK A TUMBLE,TUMBLE DOWN DOWN DOWN!! WHAT A TEAM WE ARE, ARE TRULY!” Jevil then started to pull some the rest back up starting with Sonic then hopping over to Bendy which both are surprised by but Sonic got up quickly while Bendy was still at least sitting processing it all while watching Jevil pull the rest up. </p>
<p>“We could’ve died back there, how are you so calm about this?” Sans spoke up while Jevil pulled him right back up with a grin on his face still holding Sans’s arm. “WELL,WELL BUT YOU DIDN’T BECAUSE OF YOU USING,USING YOUR BLASTY WASTY!” Jevil playfully hugged Sans’s arm as he said that when saying ‘blasty wasty’ probably to poke fun at it in some sort of way which Sans just sighed to it. Jevil then let go of his arm while laughing making sure the rest got up who were tired out still from that chase. Which Bendy stood up making sure he still has hold of the thorn that yet was guiding them to go further down the hall, but yet it looked quite dark ahead, very dark but there was spots of lights flickering to see further down that can guide them the way at least, which everyone took a second to get up, Jevil still going around to try and get everyone standing as everyone looked down the hall as well once standing, guess they got nothing to lose. They all then got close together before heading onwards to head down the hall, making sure to keep close so they won’t lose any of each other while doing so. Each taking slow careful steps, all readying to the best of their abilities for whatever is to come, rather it be more COTS lurking in the dark or if anything like plants start to come and attack again, they'd be ready. After all they have to be getting closer seeing Bendy having to get a harder grip on the thorn the further they walk. </p>

<p>Once reaching areas now where the lights flickered it allowed everyone to be less crowded, be able to determine where they are or where to go, taking turns into corners, the place having moments of darkness but then moments where the lights are constantly flickering needing everyone's focus to fully process what is there or what's not there. But each step they take they have to be getting closer, they have to be, they have to be nearing the end, they have to be. It was then a loud creek was heard behind the group, one that felt like a step, an unwelcoming one at that making everyone stare down the dark empty hallway in case anyone was there. Silence, nothing but a dead silence, one that felt like a silence when a predator has locked on to its prey waiting for the moment to strike. Which it in fact did seeing a vine charge at them out from the darkness to attack but quickly Jevil jumped in front the group to slice it off giving the group a chance to start running ahead getting the sign they have to worry for it must mean the portal could be closed if anything gets through it at all. The group keeping a fast pace, turning corners seeing Jevil catch up before then when reaching an intersection vines came at them from the sides which quickly Sonic went charging at one side and Jevil at the other to fight off the vines on those sides while the rest kept heading onwards trying to reach the portal, some starting to split off to lure any vines different ways Brook going with Baldi and Sans and Bendy going with Mugman through another route while Sonic and Jevil took a different one once catching up, each taking steps and dodging vines that started chasing or shooting out from different paths that crosses into the ones there on trying to slow them down but yet everyone kept fighting them off to keep them backed off till they all reunite and quickly go down a hall that was mostly darkness for what they are running into meaning it would be harder to keep track where the vines are within it.  </p>

<p>Though quickly can see Sans summon a blaster and making it charge up an attack to bring some light around the area despite how it seems to be draining the energy from Sans, seeing then when he did there were vines surrounding everywhere around them but Sans using the blaster made it shoot and caused it to spin around to get the vines from all sides before the blaster vanished bringing back the darkness as everyone kept moving on forward getting back to a spot with more light, the lights flickering around them as they ran onwards, they have to be getting close, they have to judging the fact Bendy is holding the thorn with both hands wrapped in them and its like when it’s trapped in his hands it kept pulling them forwards that it caused for Baldi to step in to get the thorn from him and keep it in place, since there isn’t much for combat he can do against the vines. In which more summoned around causing everyone around to fight them off together, trying to keep them held off, Sans and Jevil working together to fight off a side and Sonic and Mugman getting another while Bendy and Brook kept some backed off so Baldi can figure where the thorn goes seeing it then slip out into the darkness which Brook quickly went after getting hold of it before it fully went in, pulling it back towards only to realize… That wasn’t the only thing the thorn was attached to, seeing it latched onto a vine that was hidden ahead wrapping itself around Brooks leg when she tried to let go and back off, trying to then drag her into the darkness, which Bendy quickly noticed taking action to run towards while Baldi holds the vines off from stopping them to quickly get Brook by the hands to try and pull them back over but it became a game of tug of war, Bendy refusing to let go no matter how much the vine pulled back seeming to get the lead. Brook studied the situation, studying to see down the dark hall to try and see what’s there, studying as close as she could before a voice echoed in her head.</p>

<h5>Let go</h5>

<p>Something she wasn’t expecting, but, many times it echoed never failed her right? So she looked to Bendy seeing how hard he was trying that the rest were stuck trying to fight off the vines that none could lend a helping hand. “Bendy. Let go.” Brook spoke up, seeing Bendy look at her, seeing his expression changed to one with a lot of worry buried within it, one that looked of fear, shock even. “WHAT!? NO! I CAN’T! I- I CAN’T LOSE YOU TOO!” Bendy hollered, his grip tightening but still the vine was tugging with all its power that made it hard for him to keep holding on. “Trust me, we’ll find each other again. Just let go” Brook spoke, seeing Bendy's expression seemed more shocked to hearing it, seeing him still holding on seeing that glisten in his eyes that showed a sign of sadness that’s overcoming, which due to it made his grip loosen enough for Brook to slip out and be pulled away, Bendy chasing after trying to get Brook back which Brook kept feeling dragged hitting bumps along the way to notice the vine was dragging her right to a portal which she quickly slipped her necklace off in case this is what she thinks before being pulled right in and the portal closing behind them once entering, leaving the vines to stop fighting and flee into the shadows, and one being made of ink left staring upon where that portal was, the rest slowly going over to look on, before looking to each other as slowly came an idea in mind for everyone. Get her back. </p>

<h5>Never let go he screamed in his head</h5>
<h5>The bestest thing to ever happen slipping away</h5>
<h5>Like a fall from the highest point in the sky</h5>
<h5>Would he jump too if it meant being with the other?</h5>

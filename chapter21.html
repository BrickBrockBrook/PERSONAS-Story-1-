<h2>Chapter 21. Trust in each other </h2>

<p>Quickly can see Sans make another bone barrier for them all seeing Bendy sink right into a puddle to exit from it as Mugman charges up a beam to aim at the large brute COTS once it breaks the barrier as Baldi was studying each movement made to be sure of their safety while once Bendy got out from the puddle showing behind Luradis Brook helped by distracting Luradis a little by just seeming to struggle which Luradis seemed entertained by before Bendy quickly hit her away, due to this once the large brute COTS broke the bone barrier it quickly charged at Bendy to attack him but Mugman shot at it causing it to get confused and stunned a little giving Bendy a chance to get away and back over. Sans then quickly summoned a blaster and began to shoot at the large brute COTS as Baldi helped Mugman get to the other side of the large brute COTS very quickly to shoot at it from that side, Brook quickly tried to get to near the front to distract it now as can see Bendy take another risk on getting some goop from his back making a rope of sorts as he quickly began to pass each end to Sans and Baldi by just becoming a puddle to get to each one faster and to dodge Luradis who began to grab out a few small throwing knives they hid within there top to try and throw it at them but luckily each one was dodged. Once Brook had the large brute COTS attention which it kept trying to swat at everyone, it began to try and go over to grab Brook but the rope made it trip and begin to fall, which the group moved away from and as Brook struggled to Bendy quickly pulled Brook into the puddle with him then out from farther away from the crash so they weren’t harmed. </p>

<p>Once the large brute COTS fell it roared loudly causing the place to shake as it was getting up, Baldi quickly gathered everyone seeming to notice something was wrong and got Sans to put up another bone barrier which sure enough some spots around began to fall and crash down which could’ve hurt them but luckily Baldi was quick to notice that, though it only made Luradis more annoyed for how quick everyone was with this, guess they really have gotten better at this whole thing. Luradis then seemed to think before slowly growing a grin, getting out another strange device and aimed it at the large brute COTS and by a push of a button… nothing happened, or at least nothing visible, which yet quickly Bendy saw this as a chance to attack and tried charging at Luradis before the COTS knocked him back far, which as it tried to hit again Bendy melted into a puddle as Sans and Mugman began to shoot at the COTS again though yet during it can notice Sans and Mugman seeming like there getting tired as they do, which even seeing Bendy come out from a puddle he seems more tired out as well which Baldi quickly stopped Sans and Mugman which Brook went over to help Bendy out. “They did something to this COTS to drain us of energy quicker, don’t keep attacking it with your powers it could make it worse” Baldi spoke up which yet everyone listened in as yet Bendy seemed confused by how that’s possible and plus how can some of them fight but yet can tell he was quick to be ready again. </p>

<p>The large brute COTS suddenly tried to slam it’s hands down on everyone everyone was quickly moved aside by Baldi which luckily everyone was safe though seems he was a little drained to upon doing that, huh who knew a little bit of speed was him using a power of sorts, hopefully his knowledge isn’t affected too. Which yet can hear Luradis laughing upon seeing this now. “Oh how fun it feels like I'm taking your powers from you all! Oh how unfortunate for you! Unless you're willing to keep using them despite your energy depleting.” Luradis spoke up with a smile on her face as the large brute COTS tried to swing at them all again, which Sans quickly made a bone shield around them all for to not be hurt but can tell it drained him after the bone wall was broken as the large brute COTS roared, this is bad, which yet as Brook looked to everyone they all seem to drain each time they try to use there powers rather it be through speed or to shoot at the creature but she's the only one who isn’t, making it clear she has to figure something to do about this, which studying around perhaps the surrounding area could be to advantage, which she saw a perfect spot above where Luradis and the COTS were, which she went to Mugman quickly as the COTS prepared another swing. “Mugman, I know this is tiring but try to aim above them, it looks like up above them there are these spikes that should hurt them.” Brook informed Mugman which Mugman looked to there and nodded with a smile and aimed at them charing up a bit despite how it is tiring which yet Baldi went over to support Mugman perhaps overhearing the plan and was quick to help Mugman have some way for if he falls Baldi is there and to help focus it right and get a good shot that should only take one, which once Sans caught sight of it Sans went over to help out as well to make it stronger, while during this Bendy was quickly going over to where everyone was incase to help dodge the upcoming attack that looks like it was a planned to be a hit that could really hurt everyone maybe even kill, which while this happened Brook looked at where its being aimed and at the COTS and Luradis, it’s a hope it’ll work, this shot matters a lot here. </p>

<p>As the large brute COTS swinged down Mugman and Sans shot at where they aimed as Bendy pulled everyone down into a inky puddle quickly into this darkness for a moment then quickly back out which everyone had to take a breather for after that, which looking to where it was shot can see some of what looks like spikes overhead shaked and rumbled like it was bound to fall, which everyone was hoping would work, as the large brute COTS was readying to throw another attack which as it did can see it fall and suddenly cause a chain reaction to a lot of other spikes around which Luradis quickly went and took cover and so did the group as the large brute COTS was hit by each spike on the ceiling that came crashing down onto it causing it to fall down from all of these attacks that was thrown at it which Luradis can be heard through it all shouting “NO!” with a lot of anger in there voice, which yet the group cheered a bit as everyone began to not feel as drained now almost like it’s coming right back to them, for a moment it seems the plan wasn’t going to work and it just wasn’t strong enough, but yet by a miracle it worked, makes it really relieving to think. Once the spikes stopped crashing and the rumble around calmed, can see through this bit of dust that's picked up from it all that the large brute COTS began to vanish due to how much its hit them which can see Luradis rush over looking livid upon this, telling it to not just die and get up but to no avail. </p>

<p>She then snapped her head to look at the group which everyone looked to one another making sure they’re each okay before looking to Luradis. “Alright Luradis, your bodyguard is gone, so give up with this.” Sans spoke up for everyone which Luradis looked very upset but yet smiled after some thought, getting out two knives that looked different from the ones she's thrown before as can see a brute COTS form behind her mimicking her pose as she held up the knives at the group. “So be it! If you so very much want to win this then you're going to have to try a lot harder than that!” Luradis smiled maniacally while the group quickly got ready again for this, hopefully this is easier now especially with everyone having their energy back, just got to be ready for whatever gets thrown at them first. Quickly saw Luradis charge right at them which Bendy quickly was charging in right upon seeing this to throw a punch but was quickly caught by her putting her hand out causing the brute COTS behind her to grab his hand as she threw him aside with the strength of it. </p>

<p>Mugman quickly tried to shoot at her but the brute COTS made a shield around her guarding her from it which Sans tried to throw bones as well to try but it didn’t help with it, which she quickly threw knives both there ways which Baldi rushed in to get Mugman to move as Brook helped Sans move aside as well from it, then she quickly snapped her fingers causing the knives to come right back to her which means this is only going to get more tough due to this. Bendy quickly charged at Luradis again this time from behind but Luradis spun on her heel kicking him away which the brute COTS mimicked her making it be double which Bendy went flying and quickly became a puddle before he crashed into the ground to not be hurt to bad, which made Sans try to summon a blaster at Luradis but Luradis was able to dodge the beam quickly by letting the COTS grab her, vanishing into a shadow on the ground for a second before popping back up in front of Sans knocking him down before attempting to stab but Bendy came right out from in between knocking Luradis back, which can hear Sans say a quick thank you for, which Luradis got the COTS to throw Bendy off once he tried to throw a punch and which Bendy this time hit the wall due to it, causing Brook to come over while Mugman and Baldi rushed in to try and deal with Luradis as well while Sans tried to prepare a blaster that should hopefully help. “Okay Brook we could use one of your ideas here.” Bendy spoke up as Brook helped him back up while Bendy was clearly looking to Brook in hopes of there being some sort of idea to handle this too. Brook studied around the area for some sort of idea, trying to figure something out but her head felt it hurt a little each time she looked at the COTS, unless… </p>

<p>“How greedy do you think COTS are?” Brook asked Bendy which he looked back then realized right away what Brook was thinking. “Well hopefully greedy enough to go after any free gem now!” Bendy responded with a smile, waiting to hear what the plan exactly was as Brook moved closer to whisper the idea to him. During this can see Sans trying to hold Luradis back while Mugman was helping Baldi back up quickly which Baldi then studied the area, giving Mugman an idea to go up onto his shoulders so that way Mugman can shoot from higher up which Mugman quickly got up and tried to shoot but the COTS blocked it and quickly brute forced with Luradis through the bone shield Sans made knocking him back into Baldi and Mugman causing them all to tumble down which made Luradis laugh. Which Luradis walked over to Mugman, Sans and Baldi standing over them as she laughed as she was getting her knives ready to hurt them, which Sans tried to summon bones to block it but can tell he was far too tired out to try which Mugman was trying to do the best he can to encourage Sans and hope it gives some energy while Baldi tried to kind of block it incase it doesn’t succeed which yet only entertained Luradis more. “It’s a shame that you guys have to deal with this, and once I find where the other two went it will be a game over for you! Comedic is it not?” Luradis grinned with a manic look as she was preparing that's when Brook shouted “STOP.” causing Luradis to do so and look over now. “Oh there is one of you. Are you trying to save them now? How silly.” Luradis grinned but yet Brook looked back, remaining focused on trying to help. </p>

<p>“You can go after me first. But before you do…” Brook began to take off the necklace she wore and held it up in front of herself to offer it to them. “I know you guys need these and I feel this one could really help you alot… I find it’s really powerful since… well it’s surely magic when wearing it.” Brook added on which Luradis studied Brook then around the area which seeing nothing that could happen for how weak everyone appeared she grinned seeing it, then seeing the large brute COTS leave from behind Luradis to quickly grab it. “Well, you're so helpful with this! Although it won’t change your fate.” Luradis spoke up as this brute COTS went to reach for it but as it did, Brook then quickly threw it far away causing the COTS to chase after it which Luradis was surprised by which as she was distracted, Bendy quickly came out from the ceiling with one the spikes from the ceiling before and swung at Luradis to send her flying further away from the COTS. Brook then quickly went to where the brute COTS was which they couldn’t get the gem through the rubble she threw it into which Brook quickly got there dodging a swing by the brute COTS who tried to get her to back off which she reached in managing to grab it which the brute COTS tried to swing at her again but was quickly shot a bullet at them seeing Mugman came by to help out keep the brute COTS backed off now, which gave Brook the chance to get it back on and quickly make sure she can keep luring the brute COTS to stay far away now. During this Bendy charged at Luradis but Luradis quickly blocked his attack with the knives, quickly backing off and then began to swing the knives around fast which Bendy dodged each swing while Sans quickly began to throw some bones at Luradis to try and drive Luradis away from Bendy and the area for where the brute COTS is, which yet made Luradis try to find a way through quick. Baldi in this case quickly went to help Brook and Mugman out to drive the COTS further away which Brook quickly went over to Baldi and whispered an idea she must’ve thought of during this to try and be sure a victory can happen which Baldi understood fast and quickly went to where Luradis was but during doing so he grabbed a few rocks to prepare, and once near he whispered to Sans the idea which Sans understood while Bendy was trying to keep Luradis far back. Luradis then backed up enough, raised her hand as it seems she was preparing to call another COTS but before she could snap her fingers Baldi threw a rock at her hand which hurt Luradis from that stepping back and lowering her hand to hold from the sudden rock hard pain that was, surely perfectly aimed with that one now, which Sans began to now try and back Luradis into one the walls with bones coming out from the ground which was surely working which Luradis tried to slice them but yet another bone shot up to knock one the knives from her hand, which annoyed her more. </p>

<p>Bendy watched as it was clear Sans and Baldi got this one as he rushed over to where Mugman and Brook were, Mugman was yet about to be swung at hard by the COTS which Bendy quickly slided in and moved him aside as he quickly began to charge at the COTS to back it off from Mugman while Brook during this quickly was getting a larger rock broken off which she just finished doing so, then she readied it a bit to try and throw but yet it was very hard to carry, which Mugman rushed over to Brook to help out with it upon seeing this while Bendy kept the COTS backed away. Brook and Mugman then threw the large rock piece that was broken off at the COTS which Bendy moved the COTS right into knocking it out watching it fall to the ground because of the impact, which yet got made them celebrate a bit as to notice can see Luradis get surrounded by bones once backed up and as they cut through the bones that's when large rock spikes came down to act as an extra shield being much harder for her to cut through which she was very annoyed clearly due to this which Sans and Baldi nodded at one another with a calm smile on both their faces as a way to congratulate the other in some way. “HAHA! TAKE THAT LADY! CAN’T GET THROUGH ANY OF US!” Bendy shouted as he came over, clearly very happy they succeeded in such a way, which annoyed Luradis as this happened. “That was a clever plan from both you and Brook to separate them!” Mugman spoke up appreciating clearly both Brook and Bendy for this that yet got everyone to find a way to succeed in this. </p>

<p>“Oh please! That was mostly Brook who thought it up!” Bendy looked to Brook which Brook who had just come over gave a small smile though she looked to the rest. “Well it was more as a team that this plan even worked and went the way it did…” Brook spoke up which at least it seems everyone appreciated it, though can notice Luradis was watching before then slowly beginning to laugh, which was quiet but then got louder till everyone looked to see she was laughing upon this, oh god what is Luradis planning now. Suddenly can see weird shadows on the ground which Brook was quick to notice first and as she tried to warn everyone that's when multiple brute COTS came out from the ground quickly grabbing hold of everyone which everyone tried to move away but couldn’t which Brook was lucky to have seen ahead of time and dodged the one which only stared at her upon this, odd. Which can see the rest struggling to get free which Brook tried to go over to help but the brute COTS blocked the way. “Oh it’s clear now, one of you has been figuring ways for you all to work together to use your powers since she doesn’t have any herself! But what can she do if it’s just all by herself?” Luradis grinned, commanding the brute COTS to come over and break her free from the rocks as she walked over to stand in front of Brook but kept a fair distance. “LET US GO YOU PSYCHO!” Bendy shouted while trying to fight to get free but it was to no avail and only made him get more trapped in it all. “Keep trying, you’ll only be more trapped. Now, let’s make this a simple one on one and see who will win this.” Luradis grinned as she got her two knives ready which yet seemed unfair since Brook had no weapons, god all she had was just a small book and pencil, which surely means she's in danger, which suddenly Luradis without warning charged at her then hearing Baldi shout “DODGE.” before Luradis was too close which Brook followed by just dodging Luradis’s attack, then making it clear the idea now what to do since the rest were quick to catch on. “SIDE PUNCH!” Bendy shouted which Brook quickly tried to do but Luradis quickly dodged but Mugman added a “SPIN WHILE AT IT!” which got Brook to quickly change direction and hit Luradis a bit, which Luradis moved back but laughed, quickly charging onward which she dodged hearing Sans shout “To the left” which gave her an opening again. </p>

<p>Bendy shouted upon this saying to tackle them down, which she tried which only succeeded a bit, as she swung again Baldi quickly spoke up to turn at a specific number of degrees which Brook managed to kind of get as Sans and Mugman said to hit now managing to hit Luradis on there side knocking them to the ground, which Brook was tired out but happy she had the rest to help her figure it out. Luradis was clearly annoyed, commanding the brute COTS to cover the rests mouths so Brook couldn’t follow what they say now as Luradis grinned upon seeing Brook grow worried. “What’s wrong? Was your some form of help now obscured? Creative especially for how many decided to partake. Though foolish for you to think it will stay working the whole time. Now, what can you really do without anyone? Oh right! NOTHING!” Luradis shouted at the end charging at Brook much faster than before which Brook managed to move aside upon this getting a bit hit but still at least managed which Luradis quickly tried to throw her knife at Brook but Brook quickly went down almost like she felt pulled down but yet nothing was there that could’ve done so. Brook quickly had to figure out how to do this while she tried dodging Luradis’s fast knife swings, she just had to think about how the rest did it and how someone she knows would go about doing this as well. </p>

<p>So she quickly got her hood off as she dodged each throw, tying the sleeves together before throwing it onto Luradis arm during a swing and quickly running to behind them as Luradis tried to break free going around and hitting Luradis down though had their arm sliced a bit from one the other knives. This allowed Brook to get one the knives once one the arms was stuck, and used it to try and attack Luradis but Luradis kicked Brook off and threw the hood away once she got it off. Can hear muffled excitement though from the rest upon this like they’re trying to cheer Brook on which was nice to slightly hear. Luradis then tried to charge at Brook to try and slice with the knife but Brook quickly deflected it with the knife she got which Luradis kept swinging trying to hit Brook but Brook kept deflecting it each time the best she can, which she was managing well in doing so, before quickly tricking Luradis into doing a move to hit her with the knife now which Luradis was visibly getting annoyed by and hit Brook onto the ground and raised her hand to suddenly summon some COTS to surround Brook, like she wants to ensure a victory, guess she isn’t playing by the rules now. </p>

<p>The COTS that surrounded Brook suddenly quickly charged at her all at once which Brook moved away fast managing to just dodge them all but Luradis got behind and kicked Brook into the crowd, knocking some the COTS down but the COTS around got an opening to get Brook. She quickly managed to slide out from managing to just dodge Luradis who tried to hit her right back in as she tried to hit Luradis but a COTS quickly grabbed Brook and threw her aside onto the ground. The COTS surrounded Brook from every side while Luradis took one the sides to face Brook having a big smile on her face during this seeing Brook surrounded now. “Give up now. There is nothing more you can do against me, I can just keep summoning COTS to deal with you all! Though you put up a fair fight.” Luradis smiled as she tried to lower Brook to thinking there was no hope, which Luradis then raised her hand perhaps readying to command the COTS once more. “Au revoir!” Luradis then as she was about to snap her fingers quickly had hands grab it to grab hold of Luradis entirely to throw her down, as then each the COTS were quickly dealt with that were around rather being shot at, hit down quickly or having bones fly at them, the rest found a way out of this one. Can see how Mugman was quickly first to go over to help Brook as Sans helped Bendy keep Luradis down as Bendy was having to use the goop from his back to help out in this situation, which Baldi then came to help Brook up as well from this. </p>

<p>“You did great out there!” Mugman exclaimed which yet got Brook to smile hearing it as Baldi handed Brook back her hood which Brook got back on as she thanked Baldi for it. “How’d you guys escape the COTS?” Brook asked which Mugman was quick to answer it. “We figured a distraction plan to escape, we mostly distracted them and gave Bendy a chance to slide out and deal with them once free!” Mugman explained as which it does answer it, but now suddenly can hear visible loud annoyance suddenly coming from where Bendy and Sans are seeing Luradis was annoyed at them having their hands put in handcuffs that look much more black then usual but probably because Bendy had to quickly make them as can see she is trying to summon more COTS but it is to no avail. “And that is what happens when you mess with us! None of us are weak here lady!” Bendy spoke up with a confident tone, looking down at Luradis with a smile that showed he felt victorious which annoyed Luradis more. “You let me go now or I swear I will get someone here to make sure your asses are dealt with and won’t get in the way of this!” Luradis yelled but yet nobody was intimated at all, they already dealt with two of them anyways so this isn’t at all something of a threat. “Alright, so we won, now any information about where you guys could be located?” Sans asked Luradis which Luradis clearly refused to give an answer. </p>

<p>“COTS! COME BACK AND DEAL WITH THESE DAMN PEOPLE!” Luradis shouted but yet no COTS showed up, none could even hear her from here which annoyed her more, yeah she surely isn’t going to spit out any information at this rate. “Uhm… Maybe we should… try offering something to get her to say stuff about this?” Mugman asked the rest if that idea could work which everyone was thinking about though Luradis who was right there heard this and got annoyed. “I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING EVEN IF YOU DO! HOW DARE YOU TAKE ME AS TO BE AS SMART AS A DAMM COTS!” Luradis yelled annoyed even more which yet tosses that plan out the window now. “WELL YOU PRETTY ‘EASILY’ LISTENED TO WHEN BROOK WAS FIGHTING YOU AND WE WERE SHOUTING IDEAS ON WHAT TO DO!” Bendy yelled back to keep Luradis toned down which yet seemed to only just annoy Luradis more trying to throw her body to hit Bendy down but quickly Sans helped Bendy dodge it and get Luradis back down, yeah yelling surely may even just worsen the situation further. “Look, we basically won now, so there isn’t anywhere for you to go or call for, we won’t hurt you or do anything worse, we just want to know why any of this is happening and at least an idea to stop it.” Brook spoke up, going over to where Luradis was as she kept calm and tried to convince Luradis to at least give one little answer, but who knows if it will even work with these people. </p>

<p>“HAH! HAHA! HAHAHA! YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST STOP THIS ALL?? YOU CAN’T STOP US PLEASE! BECAUSE IF ANYONE WAS TO TRY AND GET IN THE WAY I KNOW OUR BOSS WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR GOOD AND LEAVE YOU ALL DEAD WITH THORNS STICKING INTO EVERYWHERE THAT HURTS!” Luradis laughed and went on then as she was laughing and thinking it was hilarious can slowly see her laugh settle as if a realization hit her, Brook got her to talk and now it says more. Which made Luradis more annoyed managing to move away from everyone which Sans tried to block but she got up to dodge the bones that tried to stop her as she moved her arm a bit in the ropes to press a button summoning a portal behind her now. “WELL! THAT IS ENOUGH TALK ISN’T IT? TIME TO SAY GOODBYE NOW!” She quickly pressed a button again that she could reach from somewhere and suddenly a portal summoned under Baldi causing him to fall through, same with Sans right after Baldi, Mugman quickly tried to stop it but the portal closed that caused another portal to open under him and he fell too. Brook rushed to the portal managing to grab hold of Mugmans hand as the portal kept open as Bendy was looking to Luradis laughing as she escaped which Bendy tried to go after but yet was to late, then he looked to where Brook and Mugman was, rushing over to try and help with now before suddenly being pulled in seeing a COTS grab hold of Mugman and drag him into the place as the portal then closed, leaving the place that was yet in shambles and yet left in silence. </p>

<h5>Isn’t this place beautiful to you?</h5>

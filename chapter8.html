<h2>Chapter 8. A Whole New Look</h2>
<h5>Brook?</h5>
<h5>Brook??...</h5>
<h5>Brook…</h5>
<h5>Wake up young star…</h5>
<h5>Brook?...</h5>

<p>“Brook??” She heard from a distance, she slowly began to wake finding herself in a tree but the tree was strange seeming to have red leaves that fell down looking square like and the base was like a dark indigo color, and looking around the ground had a purple grass that blew gently in the faint wind that was here as the trees had a repeating coloration like the one she was in that saved her from the fall like magic. Brook then began to check around, trying to see what she could find and even checked herself but right when she looked, she saw her outfit had changed even herself, a pastel purple like coloration on her skin and the hood appeared more of a china blue color and the sleeves actually changed to be a celadon blue color as well while seeming a lot more grand then normal for how the upper area went more out in a almost grand way then usual, even checking seeing her hair was a dark purple instead of that brown color, even feeling a flower on her head that she took off to check seeing it's a more darker pastel purple quite like the purple boots she has to go with it and all that hasn’t changed was the black pants, tank top and necklace she wore, Odd. “Brook???” She heard a voice call out again, the voice she realized was familiar, and if it is him then that means he is okay and hopefully not too hurt then. </p>

<p>“Bendy??” She shouted out, sitting up seeing if she can find a way down this tree, which when she said that she could hear the fast footsteps coming toward that are stepping through the grass quickly hearing the small rustles of each step before seeing that she was right, it was Bendy. Except Bendy appeared to look different as well in some way, although he still was black and white he had an outfit with a light gray top hat, a lighter yellow of a suit like outfit that had a dark golden color cape tied on with the bowtie he wore being now black, even his gloves turned into a light gray and his boots gained a light gray color and seemed he wore white pants to top it all off this outfit. “Woah, you look different too!” “Yeah, is Sans okay too??” Brook asked while Bendy seemed to find a way to get closer up the tree to help guide Brook down it to the ground which once on the ground can feel the grass seemed much more softer then the grass back home almost like it’s a blanket or a nice comfy carpet. “He’s alright! Just tired out and found a spot to rest, thinking he used a lot of magic even for helping us brace the fall better too.” “Well thank goodness you’re both okay from it, wouldn’t know what I would do without you both…” Brook said, looking at Bendy surely thankful they are both alright, otherwise she would be lost and yet they have become quite the friends to her to think, but then again she isn’t sure how she can say that right to them now for who knows how they’ll both react to that, even if it’s just Bendy right at the moment. </p>

<p>“Hehe, you’re a caring gal for that Brook, now come on! Let’s get back to Sans to see if we can figure out where we are!” Bendy said as a response to that in some way, beginning to then quickly lead the way a bit to where he remembers he was while Brook followed with behind, going through all these trees that looked all so unique and some having darker leaves to match the base having stars across it and these star like fruits or candies growing on the tree with the stars at times being a black color but some a red color that’s like the leaves around, quite magical as well. Till then they reached Sans who was seeming to take a moment's rest but seemed to be woken by Bendy shouting “SANS!” a few times when approaching that made him wake up and look at them quickly. He too had an appearance change due to this universe seeing how his hood that had torn holes in the sleeve now is a darker blue but has that original blue it had being a flame pattern at the bottom of it while the hood became more of a slate blue but a bit lighter that appeared very flame like looking at it, the top he wore underneath seeming more like a T-shirt that was white but had a orange flame on the inside of it going with the theme, then the shorts became now mostly a lighter slate blue and his slippers are flame like as well but also a lighter slate blue, surely to keep that blue theme but his bones didn’t seem to change color perhaps cause he is just a skeleton that is black and white as well.  </p>

<p>“Huh, So you found her? She looks…” “Different? Yeah that’s obvious but hey can recognize that face structure and niceness though to know it’s Brook” Bendy answered for Sans who listened in taking a moment to understand while he got up now going over to the two. “Right, So the universe has an effect on are forms then, this place as well seems to have magical energy for what I can sense being here, kind of like back in my universe.” Sans said, checking around the area seems to surely have a  sense of it in the air, which does make sense for it does feel similar in some way for all of them and not some sort of different sense in the air.  “Alright then! Simple! This must be perhaps somehow connected to yours if it has that or a part of yours so we must’ve been put into some other location in it so we can just head out, look for that DDraig guy and-” “No, no that doesn’t seem possible Bendy, look this place isn’t anywhere in the underground nor any places can cause this weird change in looks, this could be related for all we know but far different, like a copy but it’s been tweaked.” Sans explained what Bendy believed, which Bendy didn’t seem to enjoy hearing, so this must be much more of a situation then, in some way it’s unfamiliar if that’s the case, another new universe to her maybe even the rest. </p>

<p>“Well great! We are even farther from our goal now! What are we to do huh?? Find some portal that’s all the way back there just to question that guy?? Sit here and wait for another?? Wait for that guy to show up to be all ‘OH BROOK LITTLE GEM PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR STONE’ OR-” “Bendy, calm down, look if anything quite sure Brook has figured a plan what to do about all this, right?” Sans said while he quieted Bendy down before looking at Brook with Bendy doing so as well, they are waiting for a plan clearly, does she have one? I mean they are here right? Maybe there could be more portals to help lead to where they need to go? Maybe find someone for a lead? There’s quite a few ideas here, but then one came to mind that could work. “Hasn’t Balaur said the guy causing this has more helpers? We have only seen two of them, there could be tons more, even some here, I mean by the feeling and power this area has to even change its appearance wouldn’t it be smart to go for here as well in hopes to find power here as well?” Brook explained which Sans and Bendy looked to one another as if they didn’t really think that or think one will be figured, but Bendy did look back and gave a smile right away to show it's a good idea for her to have. </p>

<p>“Well, by the looks of it, guess it works for a plan then.” Sans said, just then before a call for help was heard from further away. The three stopped what they were doing, looking to where they all heard it, someone needed help, which they can’t let go by. Quickly Brook began to run towards the noise without having a second thought, the other two being surprised and can be heard trying to catch up right away when saw Brook try and dash right to the noise, she has to help, she doesn’t want anyone to be in danger, there has to be something she can do maybe even the rest too. Soon she got there before the other two, seeing a swarm of COTS surrounding someone having a usafa colored cloak on with the hood up hiding who it was but can hear a voice from this cloaked person having a somewhat lower but feeling it was a gentle cheery except as of now it is currently scared that was yet shouting “HELP!” trying to swat the COTS away but there were too many. Till Bendy was the second one to get here before Sans, seeing it and dashing in to attack right away, Brook checking to see Sans managing to catch up last, looking to where Bendy was going as got ready to attack as well, alright, now for her to try something. Quickly she goes by, clapping her hands together as loud as she could to distract the COTS away from who they are after as the COTS began to charge right after her but quickly a blast from Sans’s blaster on the side blasted majority of them away while Bendy charged in to handle the ones remaining as quick as he could, but one managed to get close to Brook, charging right at her, she had to do something to fight back, but then was like something else shot it multiple times seeing holes appear right into it like it absorbed what attack it seeing a bit who was doing so being the person they tried to save who had there eyes closed shut shooting as much as they could before noticed how the COTS began to fade away like a light shone on it like how they normally do once defeated. </p>

<p>The cloaked person, was taking a moment to relax now, able to see how they looked even there face being almost like there head was a cup or a mug it seemed with a big azure blue nose that kind of is like a oval ball with cartoon eyes almost like Bendy’s but more like it’s an upgrade on it kind of like toons while they had a straight straw with azure blue stripes on it, able to see they wore a teal turtleneck that had the sleeves be quite long but can be easy to get there hands out that were gloved while they wore with azure blue shorts and a black pair of shoes. “Oh, well thank you f-” “HOLD ON- WHO ARE YOU?? ARE YOU WORKING WITH SOMEONE!??” Bendy interrupted, going over to this cloaked person who was startled by it but calmed down and gave a calm friendly smile. “Sorry, Sorry, I’m Mugman, I’m sorry I couldn’t defend myself against all those and I'm not working for anyone! Just kind of ended up here.. But I did what I could to help!” this person named Mugman explained, which Bendy studied for a moment, then looked at the other two who looked back, doesn’t seem like a danger at all, so should be safe even to Brook for how he did save her for when she couldn’t do anything right away and which what is being learned in some way those who did save are safe. </p>

<p>“Well, how did you end up here then Mugman?” Brook asked, going over to them showing she does trust him and which the other two watched not suspecting it even seemed Mugman wasn’t suspecting it too but he smiled a friendly smile seeing how Brook was comfortable going near. “I sadly fell into a portal when trying to protect my brothers and my grandpa from these creatures that even went after me while stuck here in this strange place that changed my outfit.” Mugman explained which made Brook give a small worried look but a kind look for it is nice of him to do, then looked to the rest seeing Sans just looking away but seemed to be listening and Bendy looking to Brook and Mugman perhaps believing it. “Hm, you know, we could use a little more help with stopping what is causing this, even with a kind courage like yours you appear to have!” Brook said and which can hear Sans and Bendy go “What” at the same time from behind her that they’re perhaps surprised she even suggested such an idea like that, but she kept focus on Mugman who was surprised by such an offer like that.  </p>

<p>“Oh, I could help! If it saves my brothers and many others, I will do it! But what are your guys' names?” “Woah, hang on we aren’t just going to-” Sans tried to speak but Bendy quickly shushed him, seeing this as a good idea even from what Brook said for the request, which Brook smiled, offering a hand out to Mugman now, “Well i’m Brook for starts and welcome to the group Mugman!” Once Mugman heard and saw that a smile grew on his face even more but it was a friendly, excited even, he happily shook Brooks hand while looking at her saying “Thank you!” multiple times to show he surely is thankful and willing to help as well, kind of like Mugman trusts them already in some way kind of like how Bendy trusted Brook pretty quickly when they met. “Well, for a toon looking fella saying to a toon right back, I’m Bendy! Welcome to the team Mugman!” Bendy said going over and shaking hands as well with Mugman who looked at Bendy and got excited seeing the smile grow before he spoke up, “Oh you’re a toon too! Oh that’s amazing! Though I have never seen one like you, Must mean I'm lucky to meet you then!” Hearing Mugman say that made Bendy can’t help but smile more, finding that to be nice surely, looking to Brook to show he is glad Brook decided that Mugman can come along that really is clear to he is liking and trusting this guy already. </p>

<p>“Now wait a second here, We can’t just go inviting people to-” “Oh! Oh no… Sorry though this might be too right away… I’m sorry, I didn’t think of it until you mentioned it mister…” Mugman said, looking worried now, he truly does seem he didn’t mean it looking down and which made Bendy look worried then looked to Sans wondering why would Sans even say that when it’s being made even more clear he doesn’t mean no harm and really does wish to help, which got Sans to start to feel bad it did seem hearing it. “You know what? Fine, he can come along.. Just, don’t try anything that could go against us.” Sans said in which once Mugman heard that a smile grew on his face being bright and all so thankful, going to Sans and offering his hand out to shake but only if Sans did wish to which seemed quite unsuspected to him. Sans took a moment but did end up shaking it while Mugman seemed more excited than ever and happy in a way that showed he is happy to not be alone even in an unknown place like this one, which who wouldn’t be after all.</p>

<p>“Alright how about we get going ahead maybe? Perhaps in case Sans do you want to use one of your blasters to check around the area to have an idea for where we could try heading to?” Brook said that made everyone pay attention while Sans who nodded to it summoned a blaster then let it go up high and onward to begin to navigate the area and which Sans watched before he leaded to show where to go, making the rest quickly follow right away as well. “Well, Well, Brook you really are clever for how quick you thought up some things here truly, even to think of getting another member, I’m surprised actually, how come you think this fella was safe anyhow?” Bendy asked while walking alongside Brook while the other two, Sans and Mugman, were ahead seeing Mugman talking away about perhaps stories and questions of sorts while Sans only gave brief answers or comments to it all, before Brooks' focus went onto Bendy for what was said. “The COTS went against him, didn’t work alongside him like how it did for the other two even if one wasn’t trying to do harm the COTS never targeted them as well. The fear seemed too real, even then they got brothers they are worried about and I can get that as well for worrying about your brothers.” Brook explained which seemed to have left Bendy with some curiosity even when he had such a question answered already. </p>

<p>“You got brothers?? Huh, So, they must be back in the universe you live in, are you worried for them?” “Hm, Well I got the feeling they will be lucky like me to get through it all, so they should be okay.” Brook answered, looking at Bendy with a gentle smile, which Bendy smiled right back at her once saw it, got to remain positive to say, even then being around these three gets Brook feeling like it is easier to remain positive here like it’s magic. Sans seemed to then be looking up studying the sky to get an idea for where to go next but he seemed he was squinting his eye sockets interestingly as if not looking to his blaster in the sky but something else, which made Brook even cause Bendy and Mugman to look up as well in some confusion, seeing then the blaster was acting odd, going around and seeming to shoot randomly with a mighty blast, looking closer though can see what it was attacking being some sorts of odd blacked bird like creatures that also seem to appear like shadows even behave like… </p>

<p>“COTS!??” Bendy shouted out looking there in confusion but concern even for that hasn’t been something seen such as that. “What’s a COTS??” “They are those shadowy creatures that attacked you” Brook answered Mugmans question, which Sans seemed to get an attack ready, seeming to be a bone attack while he was focused on what is up there perhaps to prepare for if there is any sort of danger. Soon then came into view a much larger version, much more stronger appearing to for how much more it yet had but was no larger than that large COTS from before but seems it could very well rest upon the shoulder like a pet, going to the blaster and swatting it away like it’s a bug out from the sky to protect it’s little minions or children who swarmed around it as the blaster went flying off before vanishing like dust, then the large flying COTS looked down to them very well sensing where they are the four despite being all so high up away from them within the sky. </p>

<p>“RUN!” Mugman yelled out which became the plan quite quickly, Brook quickly starting to run with Mugman following while Sans was about to but saw Bendy focused on it readying to fight while saying “WE CAN TAKE I-” but couldn’t finish when Sans grabbed his arm and began to drag him along, following behind Mugman and Brook while Bendy managed to get free now running along with the rest. Can hear the flying creature swooping down to where they are shaking the ground around them for they can guess it landed at the spot they were at before, then quickly noticed the shadows around began to move weirdly before seeing things try to fly right at them, having to fight each one away as they ran. Sans quickly kept throwing bones at each one that came by while Mugman shot out from his hand somehow some sort of magical bullet to shoot into each of the creatures while dodging each one quickly while Bendy would often punch them away or get hold of them to throw into another helping keep Brook safe from each one that targeted her. </p>

<p>There has to be a spot to run to, but where? What would be a good spot to hide at? Got to think something, otherwise they could be running forever for more could keep coming and even the bigger one at that. “SANS YOU GOT ANY IDEAS IN THAT SKULL OF YOURS HERE???” Bendy shouted while they ran and Sans focused on attacking the enemies while seeming to be thinking now a  method around this. “Look, we need a spot to hide in here for we can’t handle all those now, like the trees here could help.” “Oh! Oh! I got an idea then! Sans! When we go by one of those trees with the stars, hit your bones into it to drop those odd fruits out! Then we can run ahead and Brook since your faster can find a spot we can hide in like a tree and Bendy can help us up into it with his strength!” Mugman then suggested after Sans spoke a bit of a method in which everyone didn’t seem to argue by and nodded their heads to it, a creative plan for him to have truly. </p>

<p>The four continued to run fighting some off till they were coming close to one the trees with those odd star shaped candy fruits on them in which Sans got a bone attack ready and threw it at the candies in the tree once they went by it knocking multiple of the candies off that made the creatures going after them look to where those fruits stopped and began going after that instead perhaps to munch on, giving them a chance to go further ahead. Quickly Brook began to run ahead as quickly as she could to go ahead of the rest to try and find a spot that could work, there had to be something that could like a big tree, maybe a hole in the tree that can fit them all into it or maybe some big bush, something that could very well work and help out a lot, just need to find something that could. </p>


<h5>Nearby… <em>He watches…</em></h5>

<p>She then checked around her, slowing down and saw the perfect spot, a tree not to big but big enough to hide them all with the various odd leaves it had, that will do perfectly, then she saw the rest catch up and gestured to them the tree to go to, which Bendy quickened his pace to get there before the other two, going to it and offering Brook a helping hand up it in which she accepted as Bendy picked her up and lifted her up onto it. Then soon Mugman was next then Sans as well before Sans helped pull him up onto it as now they can just hide away from those flying COTS which can be heard coming over but going right by going all sorts of different directions around the place but yet couldn’t find them at all, the plan worked. “Well, Well,Well! Now that was creative thinking if I say so myself! Who’d think that would work??” Bendy said quietly, looking at Mugman with a smile that yet made Mugman happy to see that smile and even get some praise for his creative thinking. </p>

<p>“Well I would’ve not thought of it if Sans didn’t really say anything! Got me to think of seeing you guys for the first time use your strengths for when something happens and thought it could help us hide!” Mugman explained keeping his voice low as well as he then looked to Sans which Sans looked back to him not really suspecting it but did get him to think about it and seemed to find it quite nice in some sense. “Wait, I thought they would’ve targeted us anyway, not go for some weird food on the trees because they could take Brooks necklace!” Bendy said, having then a bit of a growing suspicion on it already, which Mugman took notice of quickly. “Well when being stuck here for a bit before I got chased I found these candies actually have magic in them because when you eat them you feel stronger!” While Mugman said that he took a moment going into his cloak to get something out then pulling one the star like candies out and breaking off the points and handing them out to everyone. </p>

<p>Everyone each took a piece and studied it, which Brook studied it seeing it did look as so on closer inspection to be a candy of sorts that had a texture of a fuzzy fruit almost like a peach in some sense. Taking a careful bite now, the candy has an odd taste. It was sweet like candy and a bit squishy like a jelly almost, but yet it had a new unfamiliar taste she yet hasn’t had before but yet why does it feel it has a sense of familiarity? “Oh wow this is delicious! And it does make you feel stronger, guess that must be the magic!” “Yeah it is! It does taste like it, right?” Mugman responded to what Bendy said then looked to Sans then Brook, seeing how Sans was yet a bit surprised but seemed to find it familiar but tasty in some way, but yet Brook sits here seeming to question it a bit, she’s never had something like it she thinks.  “This kind of tastes like the food back in my universe, it helps heal you if you're hurt or low on magic.” Sans spoke up now, studying the piece he had that he is taking his time to eat, which caused everyone to have their focus on him now. </p>

<p>“Well that says a lot then! Hey wait that means then this universe could have a chance of being a way to find those guys! Great! So after this snack we can begin to search, where first?” Bendy said, looking to the rest for ideas while eating, it seems everyone looked to one another to see if an idea would come to mind for anyone. “Maybe we can look for some sort of idea around the area like a sign like maybe in the sky?” “Oh! Wait, I remember when I got here I saw a big beam in the sky! That’s where we can go!” Mugman said in response to what Brook said, which she smiled at hearing that surely can rely on Mugman for this. “Perfect! Alright, Universe two here we go!” Bendy shouted with excitement that the rest cheered a bit back with, universe two here they are.</p>

<h5>Another world, another threat…</h5>
<h5>Another  day, another death…</h5>
<h5>Fate certainly has something sealed for some, does it?.</h5>

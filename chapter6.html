<h2>Chapter 6. The Enlightenment From Another</h2>

<p>One, two, three… Counting, counting each small snowflake that fell and each COTS seen lurking in the darkness but fleeing once catching sight of who is leading them back into the forest for where DDraig had fled into, feeling that cold air blow against them that caused a shiver down Brooks spine as she followed this guy learned as Balaur with the other two Sans and Bendy to see if this supposed to be issue will cause more madness around, which to think is better to be in this forest then be at that town running with COTS and that much larger COTS that can very well crush them all like bugs. For what was heard now was only the wind noise often made when it goes by your ears and the crunching of snow under one's feet along with the quiet breathing from everyone to show they are alive and this all is too, which makes one get that reminder it’s real, and this moment that happening is as well, who is this Balaur guy is truly a wonder, is he really good and it seems deceiving or is it all a trick that was yet waiting to be revealed in the long run? Certainly is unknown to Brook, maybe even to the rest.</p>

<p>“Well, well, what happened to have caused you two guys to meet such a gem anyways? Surely does sparkle in the light now” Balaur spoke up, glancing over to the three which Bendy looked confused by what Balaur meant while Sans seemed to kind of guard Brook who was weirded out by that name once again even for how it was explained. “Quit calling her that. Look, we just found her trying to escape some COTS and we saved her.”  Sans explained, which Bendy gave Balaur a look when learned Balaur was calling Brook this which Balaur only laughed at. “Oh I see, I see, she’s unique, such a unique ge-” “HEY! STOP CALLING BROOK THAT! WE ALREADY SAID QUIT IT SO QUIT IT!” Bendy spoke up now getting the idea now that the nicknames here were making Brook uncomfortable by it but surely is lucky to have these two defending her from this sort of thing even though she could’ve tried to herself.  Balaur seemed to look over, giving a small grin before speaking up “I see, I see, it’s not appropriate to call others who own the gem that now, I get it.” “They aren’t a couple, they literally met I say about three hours ago.” Sans spoke up that which Bendy then looked confused by it as if understood that as something else which Brook was confused by Balaur saying that but with Sans speaking up surely has her embarrassed in some way. </p>

<p>“Oh enough of this now, there are more things more important to focus on, like finding where that villainous guy fled to” Balaur spoke while focused on what is ahead, surely seeming dedicated to finding this ‘villain’ otherwise known as DDraig to stop them, but yet versus the other two who may be confused by his exact goals for a wonder if this all truly is a big scheme or not, Brook felt she can see the truth that caused the urge to ask questions now, to find out what's up. “Sir, why do you want us to come with you if you can handle it alone when we could’ve stayed aside to wait for you to get back?” “Oh young girl, I saw how you all battled, I would need you all to handle the issues on the side while I handle the main, besides perhaps this fella has answers you're looking for correct?” Balaur responded, continuing to lead the way which Brook remained silent for, answers… that’s a doubt for that it surely feels, but why? That is yet another wonder why she feels such a burning doubt on how he could give any sort of answers to this or even other things. Cannot solve the mystery on… </p>

<p>“But… Wouldn’t it be more logical if-” “Oh nonsense sunshine! Besides, the creatures did stop bothering you all with me here now, correct? So I’m sure you’d come to love it then with me being here now.” For Balaur to say that surely left Brook concerned and surely didn’t like the nickname, which seemed to have caught Bendy’s attention quite quickly, then looking at Balaur with a slight glare, “HEY! We just said to quit the nicknames! We always can turn right around you know and fall right into a portal to leave you here you know!” “Oh my apologies, must’ve been offensive, but we wouldn’t want you fleeing off into the wrong universe now, after all you could always end up in a place that could be a war for crying out loud with or without these hideous creatures all across this webby space.”  Balaur explained after Bendys' shouting that only made Bendy give a slight glare while they all continued to follow Balaur who was all so odd. Brook seemed to think for a moment now thinking of what Balaur said then spoke up now, “Wait, space isn’t webby, it’s meant to be open and expanding even-” “Oh how you and I talk of two different spaces, shows how little knowledge you currently have, but not to worry, dear old Balaur will teach you it all even to the rest of you. As someone good will do now.” Balaur smiled, looking at Brook, staring directly at them that felt it sent a chill down Brooks spine that surely didn’t seem the breeze yet could cause.</p>

<p>“How do you actually know what these COTS are?” Sans then asked, which Balaur focused forward thinking of a way to respond before he did so, “Because this enemy we are looking for has a boss who brought these creatures here, he’s heard so much about them and their abilities that who wouldn’t want to use them for evil doings? The boss was clever enough to find a way to take many and prepare a madness with some helpers of his to be sure the madness happens. Unfortunate how the amount of minions they got now is more then seven which isn’t lucky now” Balaur explained, which made the three give a look between one another, interesting how Balaur yet knows all this that brings even more questions on the table. “How do you know this sir?” “What’s also the wonder is who is the boss!??” Bendy added on to what Brook has yet asked which made Brook look at Bendy then to Balaur curious for an answer quite like how Bendy was and even Sans too. “Well now, the one we are dealing with is my enemy and there will yet be others who also have enemies from it that I am working with to stop these scums now, as we do learn all so much about it. As for the boss now? Oh he’s a twisted man, can’t imagine anyone to be more twisted than him, a focused man and may do dirty business on the side if you get what I mean now, although he may not have a power far outstanding oh he is powerful, can really put up a fight till the building it’s in collapses, but he always will fall victorious even after we tried to fight him, couldn’t land a good enough blow no matter what we did.” Balaur explained all in such a long story, surely a lot they happen to have said it can be believable for it’s ways for how there was yet such a story to go with it.</p>

<p>Yet left a silence while continuing to follow Balaur, thinking of it all and yet Brook was to, a man twisted who else can be more twisted, a real danger this person must be, but no need to worry much, one could stop it, they got the other two and hopefully three to help, things will be okay. “How does he look?” Sans asked, seeming to take a clever approach to this as to not ask any wrong questions like how they all possibly could accidentally do, could raise suspicion for this one guy that is unknown for what he can and can’t do. “What a question to ask truly. Surely a tall man, taller than you three and even me, has an evil grin with pointy horns, an outfit grand and out there to feel of power and yet plenty and I mean plenty of vines for everyone to deal with.” Balaur explained, continuing onward while he still kept some sort of grin on his face, odd for him to do that during a time like this, but then again there is some who are to try and keep the mood bright, but not really grin though since they smile more then grin in such a way, so it makes it odd. </p>

<p>“How’d we find this man?.” Brook then suddenly asked which has caused Balaur to stop walking, a silence filling the air while the other two turn and look at Brook hearing her ask that while she didn’t have time herself to think it, she just kind of asked, like something had told her to ask it that yet even left her to go quiet for daring to ask such a thing. “And, why out of everyone here would you wish to see him? You’re the one without power clearly, Well, unless you count looks as one of them.” Balaur asked with a grin that felt off, something about it was certainly odd, this made Brook go quiet for a moment from all that even the comment. “I want to stop him. Stop him from causing this madness, even if I do not have the power to. I feel the need to.” Brook explained, which only was left with silence amongst everyone, not a word spoken from anyone who had all attention to Brook. Brook looked at everyone, seeing how they are, Balaur seemed more confused one wishes to, Sans looked as though he was concerned perhaps questioning it, then Bendy, he stared, surprised to hear it, but yet saw is expression shift into a smile versus the rest there who didn’t smile or even grin, but he did when nobody else was. “Well, then you are not doing that alone now! If this is the guy causing it then that means we got to stop him! Now who agrees??” Bendy spoke up, going by Brooks side to show he will join her for such a goal, not having to try and face this alone, which felt reassuring to have him on her side.</p>

<p>“Hm, well, already got brought into this so guess I’ll go with.” Sans spoke up now, looking at the two which caused Bendy to smile more and Brook to smile a little at this, which can notice now Balaur only watched with a stern look, looking at each one of them with that look before he seemed to mumble something then checked around. “You all may as well be crazy to be willing to go do that now, but perhaps after this situation maybe I will guide you to a way right to him.” Balaur explained with the grin showing again, which made the rest look at him curiously hearing such news before, thud, and again, thud, even with a shuffle to go with each thud that was suddenly heard, causing everyone to go silent and look to where it was heard, upon looking it was like a looming shadow was coming over a section of the forest, like a cloud casting over the sun bit by bit except this darkness was yet all in one spot and the height of the trees around, a danger to say approaching step by step that drags across the ground. “Oh shit.” Balaur said out loud, looking to where this darkness was, having not a look of fear but more a look of being focused and serious now, He then turned to look at everyone else perhaps thinking fast about what to do. </p>

<p>“Alright, you want to fight the guy, this will be your test of power and skill, although I doubt you’ll manage to fight this ten foot or taller beast, But if you can, that certainly makes things a start to this goal of yours.” “And what are you going to do?” Sans asked Balaur who had discussed this plan of sorts, which Balaur looked at Sans hearing it, still remaining that serious look before speaking up, “I will focus on going ahead and finding the target, Otherwise it would be foolish to go making it easy for you guys.” he then turned, looking at the looming danger that was approaching them step by step that was only lifted the slightest but often was shuffled across the floor to pile up snow, he seemed to certainly show no fear to it. “Alright! We can get through this guys! Look Sans has the magic stuff, I can pack the punches and Brook can be the lead to things so there isn’t much to-” before Brook could begin to hear the rest suddenly she felt a quick grab around her and a rush of a feeling as if she got pulled into this rush speed of things like fast forwarding through a movie or some sort of film to reach a spot that yet all she can hear now was nothing but the silence of the wind around, only one can imagine what yet could be happening with her friends at that. </p>

<p>“BROOK! BROOK! OH THAT LITTLE BASTARD!” Bendy yelled in quite the anger seeing how Balaur was ahead but yet not alone and which he was gonna charge after but Sans stopped him to see the creature stepped right where the way to block it and looked down upon them with that faceless face of darkness like all the other COTS have surely clear this is yet the larger ones of it perhaps one the largest ones, this made Bendy go quiet seeing it and remembering the other danger here. “Bendy you have to keep focus here, flipping out and trying to run to danger won’t help, if we can handle this issue as quickly as we can we will be able to get to her.” Sans explained, looking at the danger which only grew closer and closer, seeming to plan to stomp them like they were a bug on the ground, causing a stress to fill the air due to the very thought. “Alright, Well come on then! You got any ideas in that skull of yours?” Bendy asked, readying for this but backed further away to not risk being closer to a looming danger which Sans seemed to follow with for that. “Well here's one, Dodge.” Sans said, till suddenly looked up to see the large COTS foot began to come down about to stomp them, causing Sans to teleport away and Bendy to quickly melt into the ground and out the ground once further away from there, shaking off the snow that got on him as then readies to attack the creature, hand clenched in a fist before charging and jumping up about to throw a punch. </p>

<p>During it Brook felt dropped to the ground, further from the rest feeling the snow beneath her that provided a cold but comforting feeling, sending a chill that made her get up slowly to look to see she was alone except alone with one person being Balaur who stood with there back to them, looking the direction to see from a far the shadowy aura of that large COTS in the distance and seeing the faint blasts and bone attacks or a punch or kick being thrown to try their hardest to fight back. This made her quiet and watched Balaur stare off into that direction who then fixed his hat that was crooked, then slowly turned to face Brook who had an expression of quiet fear, something surely was telling her to feel scared for some reason. “Your friends, they're quite the fighters. Would’ve been dangerous for a human like you even carrying that íroesite around.” Balaur spoke, looking down at Brook who was still sitting on the ground, making his way slowly to her. “You know what it is?...” “Of course little gem, It’s required to know what those powerful stones hold, power… heh, you know I suspect you figured something about all this, how clever human girl, how clever.” Balaur responded, a tone this time more with a sinister sound that made Brook go quiet from it. </p>

<p>“You're a peculiar girl to risk doing such things now, it’ll cost your life now after all to even do it and yet I don’t think you can get past this other obstacle that you have to face alone now.” Balaur inched closer, making Brook fall back to try and back further away from him but he quickly stopped her by putting his foot onto her chest to push her down into the snow and hold her there with his foot, beginning to grin now that can be seen on his shadowed out face. “Girly you cannot run, My as fun as this could all be for just us two there are much more important things to be done, for now, how about you hand that gem over and I take you right back home to your normal human life with other normal humans and not have to stress and feel to help because let’s face it here little gem, you have no power.” Balaur continued, lowering down a bit keeping his foot against Brooks chest making it hard to breath able to see that shadowed out face better that under this hat that shaded out his face was two eyes with the sclera a light yellow and the iris and pupil a white coloration being a thin toothpick like shape quite similar to a dragon's eyes that felt they glowed within the darkness that hat gave. </p>

<h5>Powerless…</h5>

<h5>Powerless...</h5>

<p>Her head began to hurt, it surely did, she had to fight the best she can, it’s what the other two would’ve wanted, she has to, she took a moment to study Balaurs face, till suddenly quickly hits her kneecap into his jewels, causing Balaur to tumble back that got his foot off and took a moment to handle the pain that gave giving Brook an opening to get up quickly and stand to face him properly. Once Balaur gained his focus, he began to chuckle a little, then began to laugh, he began to laugh a lot, then looked at Brook with a larger grin on his face, getting hold of the brim of his hat and his other hand getting hold of his coat getting the buttons on it undone. “Oh you want to fight rough now? Alright, let’s fight. LET’S SEE HOW LONG YOU WILL LAST!” He shouted out before he threw the hat off along with the coat to reveal the two sets of white horns going up on his head and a light yellow horn in the center even to see black messy hair, as then the outfit underneath revealed to have a spiked collar and spiked wristbands and a odd top of sorts with a light yellow diamond on the front along an odd pair of black very short shorts that had light yellow golden like boots that had those claws one was familiar with, able to even see one arm was skeleton like and a leg was skeleton like to, not only that but revealed a pair of dragon like wings that had that bordeaux color as well, then he seemed to laugh more loudly and shouted again, “COME AT ME ÍROESITE GIRL! SEE IF YOU’RE REALLY THIS HERO FOR THE HEROES STONE!” he grinned as Brook prepared for a very difficult battle. </p>

<p>A loud roar came out that felt it shook the very world for how loud it was of pure rage that came from this ungodly beast that the two continued to face off against, blast after blast being shot right at the creature but yet the creature still stands, which when Bendy tried to attack he got swatted away and hit right into a tree making himself be inky enough to only splat then form back but did seem it did hurt, making Bendy take a moment sitting on a branch in the tree the ink beginning to bubble and heal up at the spot he wished to heal that covered up with ink the injuries for where it was. “Alright, let’s keep going, there has to be something to stop this creature.” Bendy said beginning to roll up his unnoticeable sleeves he wore that revealed not just that same black coloration but splat like spots that were a white coloration that matches his face, looking on ahead to the large COTS that was trying to fend off the blasts and attack what causes each one which Sans kept trying to hold off and stop this being, while Sans seemed to be checking around for Bendy for where he could have gone. There has to be something to be done, there has to be, but what could work? What’s the best thing to try and do here to defeat this creature? Need to do something here of some sort to stop it. </p>

<p>Then he heard a branch breaking from above him, making Bendy look up quickly and move to the one below it seeing snow fall down and land on the one branch then more fell to reach the bottom, which Bendy watched land down and land on someone’s head below, making Bendy look confused trying to figure who it’s landed on seeing that familiar burgundy color on what can be figured to be a hood, that’s the guy from before who must’ve been watching or the cause but then again now it’s became a growing doubt for everything. “Hey! You're that DDraig guy!” Bendy shouted down, making his way down which when the person looked up startled by such a thing it was clear it was DDraig for sure who stared and was ready to run guessing how Bendy was going to react. “No! Don’t run, wait! Brook told me what you did to help and well- could use it again here if it helps you!” Bendy shouted again, quickly making his way down to stop in front of DDraig who was startled and moved away studying Bendy from him saying that. “But aren’t you with that-” “No! No he’s not here! He ran off actually he even did with Brook which makes it clear it’s bad even for what he was saying and such it’s clear he’s planning something!” Bendy explained which made him think of it and start to feel the need to search again, but for now he can’t. </p>

<p>“Wait she's stuck with- Oh no oh no- SHE’S IN DANGER! HE’S GONNA BE AFTER THE GEM SHE HAS AND HE IS GONNA HURT HER AND- Oh no he needs to be stopped or he’ll hurt her like how he has to- others!..” “How?? There’s a giant COTS blocking the way there and I have to defeat it to even get to her!” Bendy asked, gesturing to the direction of where it was seeing those blasts that the large COTS was trying to fight back against that was only getting less and less showing to blast by the minute meaning Sans is getting tired. “O-Okay I uh- I will help uh- but uh- it’s going to be tough for i’m not the strongest and-” “HEY! Don’t say that, it doesn’t help saying that about yourself and that’s something to learn. You have strength, you just have to believe you can do it even if you do or don’t have powers for combat.” Bendy interrupted DDraig for what he went on about which made DDraig look at Bendy thinking of what was said and made him think before he focused now, seeming to look at Bendy with some familiarity as looks to the direction of it then to Bendy with a worried look still on his face. “Alright! Lead the way then.. Uh- Brenk?” </p>

<p>“It’s Bendy, not Brenk. Now come on!” Bendy corrected before he focused on ahead and began to run towards the direction to where that large COTS was making DDraig stumble a bit before rushing to follow with so he can help out at least for this sort of thing. He has to do something, he has to stop this, save her, makes him wonder how he trusts her and wants to help her all so much, there must be an answer to why, but guess something tells him there isn’t a single danger of sorts about her, even if they’re human. Even then one of them could go if DDraig is strong enough, like Sans for his power he can handle this so easily and not have to worry about the worst happening right? He can protect anyone he does care for after all with ease to say, even then Bendy could go after them, handle that before it gets worse for DDraig made it sound something terrible is going to happen and he surely doesn’t want that, not even to happen to her.</p>

<h5>Oh how below some can go…</h5>
<h5>Rather in a mental state, feeling,...</h5>
<h5>Or be dragged right far down further below then six feet under.</h5>

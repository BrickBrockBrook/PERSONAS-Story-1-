<h2>Chapter 24. Fighting Together</h2>

<hr class="new2">

<p>Swings were being swung, blasts upon blasts went by as enemies charged forward to strike at what it could, as dodge after dodge kept on needing more to dodge any magical attacks this person may throw towards them all as they commanded the COTS that kept on coming. Sans and Baldi both were getting tired for how much keeps getting thrown their way that is making it harder to attack and dodge, though Jevil, he wasn’t tired one bit, kept on handling each COTS fast and pushing the others to help them dodge stuff and charging at this person but keeps on being tossed back no matter how much he tries, till when all were knocked back further that’s when Jevil began to seem annoyed and looked at the two. “WHY ARE YOU BOTH SO TIRED,TIRED!?? COME ON,ON! WE NEED TO KILL THIS FIEND,FIEND!” Jevil yelled, which Baldi was quick to first try to explain. “Jevil we don’t have as much energy as you! Plus it’s hard to think on what to do exactly to win this when they keep throwing stuff out at us!” Baldi spoke back at Jevil through the exhaustion which Jevil seemed confused by not getting it exactly. “Guess that’s a fault on your guys' end of cooperating.” This person spoke up, seeming to get more COTS to come in, seeing that red magic above their heads and sending them towards the three. Though realizing what was said, seeing that magic even on the COTS made Sans realize an idea that can work. “Jevil, you may not get us right now but at least try to help, deal with all that comes our way right now, just go nuts.” </p>

<p>Sans spoke up while Baldi and Jevil listened, which once Jevil heard he could ‘go nuts’ he grinned widely and quickly started charging at the COTS swinging at all of them with his scythe and throwing attacks everywhere while doing so.  While this happened Sans studied around the area before looking to Baldi. “What’s the fastest way to get to the other side without getting in the crossfire?” Sans whispered but remained loud enough for Baldi to hear. “Down back the hall we came from, take a left and through one the rooms and through the window, or taking a left, go down, another left then a left and you’d be at the far end.” Baldi answered keeping a low tone as well. “Alright.” Sans said before summoning a blaster and sent it to the directions Baldi has said, which quickly Sans looked to where the person was, just got a figure a distraction and a way to catch them off guard simply, which an idea came to mind, which Sans went over to Jevil quickly as Baldi went in to help keep some the COTS backed off. “Jevil, Stay still a second, trust me this will help you fight.” Sans spoke up which Jevil was confused at first, till Sans put a blue magic around Jevil and sent him flying towards this person which he made disappear to give Jevil a chance to start trying to swing right at the person already rapidly swinging around to get rid of any COTS that try to get in the way. </p>

<p>This person quickly try to bring up more COTS to block Jevil but when none of those worked they quickly put there what can be figured as a hand in front of them and shot out the magic at Jevil right in the face which made Jevil fall and seemed the magic has put Jevil right to sleep seeing this red magic particles of sorts circle around Jevil as he was knocked out, seeing this person have to take a second to breathe after that. Suddenly there was no time for this person to react now having the blaster ram right into this person to hit them into the ground and rested on them to keep them down, knocking the magic off of all the COTS and Jevil who got up quickly readying to attack but Sans quickly stopped Jevil from attacking the person and the blaster then turned him to deal with the rest of the COTS now. Baldi walked over to this person and went a bit down to their level. “Alright, enough fighting here, who are you? Why are you doing this especially when at the start you seemed you have to but didn’t want to?” Baldi asked the person who was trying to get up but the blaster kept the person right down. “...Watch out.” The person spoke up, confusing Sans and Baldi, but noticed a COTS dashing right towards past them to aim for the person but Jevil quickly sliced it in half from behind watching it fade away as Jevil laughs at the sight of it. “...You can’t control them normally, can you?” Sans asked the person who looked back then away to think on what to do, but yet they took a deep breath and looked to the three. “Unfortunately that is the case. No surprise the boss would do that as an emergency protocol to deal with the ones who just are failing to fight.” The person answered which leaves it confusing to think, maybe that’s why the times COTS attacked others relating to the people did so as a protocol to deal with the ones that can’t fight? Quite unfortunate to hear if so. “As to answer some previous ones, my name is Ezose, I work for someone back in the universe I am from along with a few others, but judging by the looks you guys have, you figured that.” The person now known as Ezose answered another and even was able to figure their expressions quickly as a way to know what’s going on, which gave Sans and Baldi more questions to ask but Jevil then quickly interrupted. </p>

<p>“WHY AREN’T,AREN’T WE KILLING THEMMMM?? THEY GOT IN,IN ARE WAY LET’S KILL THEM!” Jevil complained, which made it clear Sans had to be the one to answer for this. “We only kill the COTS Jevil, unless this is a really bad person then maybe then we will kill them, but they are not, okay?” Sans explained which Jevil stared trying to understand but just gave an annoyed sigh stepping away to let Sans and Baldi do more talking. “What’s the universe look like by chance?” Baldi asked which Sans never really thought to ask any of the others they’ve met, guess that it is fair to really question exactly what it is now for how deep they are into this. “Why should I tell you guys anyway?” Ezose questioned while struggling to get the blaster off them but the blaster just pushed them more down into the ground. “Let’s see how many names we can list then for people we can guess you’re working with, DDraig, Balaur, Alovo, Uvilein, Solgo, Luradis-” “Okay, Okay, stop I see you know enough.” Ezose interrupted Sans who had begun listing which at least seemed to help get some form of information somehow. “It’s just a universe that is called the In Between universe, I can’t tell you more.” Ezose explained a little about it but not really described what’s expected to be seen there, but it gives an idea of what the universe could appear to be. “Alright, are there any others you’re working with around here?” Baldi questioned, another fair question to be asking which even intrigued Jevil to listen in on since to guess for Jevil he thinks more for him to attack if there are any others here. </p>

<p>“Yeah, they needed extra help here because something around here keeps taking down all the progress here.” Ezose answered which caused Sans and Baldi to look to Jevil now, guessing he must’ve been the cause, which Jevil looked at them all confused a little but then laughed, well it is surely to be thankful that Jevil is on their side now. “Oh that's what was happening.” Ezose grumbled once it was known Jevil was the cause of that leading to this situation. “Alright then, now, if you know, tell us where these people are in this place and we'll be on our way.” Sans spoke up which Ezose gave an unsure look on saying but what else can he really do Ezose is stuck here and luckily Sans, Baldi and Jevil have the upper hand here anyway. “They said somewhere on the west end of this place, but that’s all I can say.” Ezose answered just now resting against the ground to just deal with defeat as the blaster only stayed on them more. Baldi took a second to listen in until now once he heard that, listened in, looked in a direction then to Sans and Jevil. “Sounds like the others are back that way too, though it sounds like they aren’t alone.” </p>

<p>Baldi spoke up causing Sans to nod as Jevil quickly got excited once hearing others will be there, quickly preparing their scythe right away for combat. Baldi then quickly began to lead as Sans looked to Ezose lifting the blaster off them though gave a look that said “Do anything and we’d find you again” before following Baldi as Jevil before going stuck his tongue out at Ezose then followed after to try and get to the combat first. The three went onward quickly, Baldi leading the way knowing whereabouts they are due to having been able to hear them and due to knowing the layout best since this is Baldis home universe after all, which Jevil was quick to try and get ahead to ready to fight but often takes a wrong turn and Sans has to get Jevil back to following them. Turn after turn and going past hallway after hallway can start to hear something going on further ahead somewhere of what sounds like a battle going on and hints of the others just either attacking or trying to figure out some plan while trying to not be hurt. Whatever is happening there doesn’t sound good one bit though and as they got closer that's when Jevil charged ahead to try and get there first due to hearing it but ran face first into- air somehow? Which Jevil looked confused trying to push at the air and it looks as though there was like a wall there, just preventing them from going forward, Baldi studied Jevil do so and began to check himself to try and touch and see if there is a wall and sure enough it seems there was some kind of invisible wall, how though? What could’ve caused it? </p>

<p>And as it gave them a second to think on it Sans then threw a bone into it to try and break seeing a red magic of sorts then threw the bone right back which Jevil caught before it could hit Sans. To guess judging by this red magic, this must be from… “Ezose.” Baldi figured out after having seen that, looking to Sans and Jevil who looked back at Baldi agreeing to the conclusion that this must’ve been their doing. Which sure enough, when they looked back they could see some COTS with the red magic near their heads as they charged at the three, which Jevil charged right in slicing it in half as can see more COTS began to quickly come right in to try and attack them now. Sans quickly took to one the halls as Jevil went for the other to start shooting down it with a blaster and summoning bones to get rid of what’s there while Baldi checked any hallways that had no COTS currently to see if Ezose is hiding amongst one of those but once having no luck with that, that's when can see Jevil get thrown right into Sans from one the brute COTS in the hallway Jevil was taking care of. Baldi quickly went into one the rooms to grab something off one the desks in there as he went into the hallway as Jevil and Sans get back up as Baldi shook what he had seeing it seemed to be some kind of soda and shot it out at the brute COTS that came charging towards seeing it manage to push them far back away from them which the brute COTS tried to fight it off but couldn’t. </p>

<p>Sans then came over and shot the blaster down that hall as Jevil began to take care of the once Sans was doing and quickly that brute COTS was handled with. “Clever thinking there Baldi” Sans commented which Baldi gave a small smile hearing it as they got back to focusing on handling this situation they’re in. COTS only kept on coming and luckily the three kept on handling them to the best they can till a loud roar was heard, causing the three to look to down one the hallways seeing a large COTS that was a mixture of a brute one and one of those fast running ones being quite large where its a surprise it even can fit in the halls, seeing Ezose standing behind it, looking to the three with a neutral expression that then showed a hint of an apologetic look before sending the COTS to go charging at the three meaning they are in for a fight with this one. </p>

<hr class="new2">

<p>Dodging each and every swing that gets swung seeing walls break whenever missed or holes get created into the floor every single time as this person known as Clubtacka kept on trying to attack the four, Mugman keeping his distance to try and shoot at them from afar while Bendy and Sonic kept trying to charge in to take them down but usually get knocked back from any of the swings due to how hard they clearly hit while Brook helped Mugman out incase they got to close in dodging while tried to think of a way they could get around this since surely one wrong move and Nuqx could even be the one to bring them all pain as Nuqx could also be making this wind up stopping quickly if they were closer, looking to them Nuqx was keeping a fair distance, which is nice though worrisome when Clubtacka looks to Nuqx to try and tell them to get closer before being hit by either Bendy or Sonic each time they do. Till suddenly can see Sonic get thrown off far into one the hallways as Bendy was thrown at Mugman and Brook soon after knocking them all down. Clubtacka then began to charge at them all to swing but Brook managed to get up through that and find a way to hit Clubtacka away before the swing so Mugman and Bendy could get back up again which Bendy right after quickly threw Clubtacka far back while they were stumbling from being knocked away into one the further walls so they won’t try and attack Brook and Mugman. Mugman once up began to shoot at Clubtacka again as Brook took a second until she noticed Sonic coming back from one the halls looking around, saw Brook and waved at her to come over seeming he must’ve noticed something. </p>

<p>Brook quickly signaled to Mugman she’d be right back which Mugman noticed what was going on, nodding in understanding as Brook dodged her away around Clubtacka which Bendy kept held back the best he could as once over, Sonic quickly dashed down the hall signaling to Brook to come down which Brook followed. Going down the hall, can see what he was looking at now seeing sure there was another hall it turns into that also split off into a few others but can see COTS charging into one the halls but attacks were being thrown out by them seeing these scythes into the walls or what looks like suits on cards go hitting into the walls, or… bones? Wait, bones! Brook smiled a little realizing this could mean by chance that maybe the rest are here! Which no wonder Sonic wanted them to come see. “That’s got to be the rest! Come on we can get them to come help” Brook spoke up, “Hey! That’s a great idea! Let’s go!” Sonic smiled, which as they went forward they both were knocked back quickly as it felt there was a wall right in front of them for when they tried, what the? How is that happening? Which Sonic kept trying while Brook stepped back to study it, seeing him push at it before curling into a ball and spinning rapidly before charging at it to attack it seeing a red effect come off the wall clashing with the blue going on with Sonic as he was before being shot backwards right into the wall behind them. “Owww.. Okay don’t just do what I did!” Sonic groaned while he got up now after that having happened from that. Suddenly both had to dodge as can see Bendy was tossed down this hallway as well seeing him splat into a puddle on the wall to embrace the impact before going out from it readying to charge in again. </p>

<p>“THIS IS SERIOUSLY GETTING ON MY NERVES HERE WITH THIS-” “Bendy! Wait- Sonic and I found a way we could stop this! We think the rest could be here and are just in this hallway, but there is some kind of wall, is there a chance you can get by it?” Brook interrupted Bendys annoyance which he looked over confused which Sonic quickly went over to show Bendy that there's this invisible wall blocking their way, which Bendy studied for a second, gave a nod before sinking down into a puddle to see if he can get by from where he was. During this Sonic quickly dashed away to deal with the Clubtacka situation so Mugman isn’t left stuck trying to not get hurt which by the sounds when Sonic went in it just got more chaotic so hopefully they can be quick with this one. Bendy then came out from the puddle on the other side of this invisible wall giving a thumbs up to Brook to show it was successful before quickly having to dodge a scythe be thrown down the hall and hitting the wall, which Bendy turned to look who did and quickly had to dodge a jester charging at them going right by again but holding onto a scythe as well and trying to swing at Bendy while laughing. “WOAH THERE! QUIT THAT I AM NOT AN ENEMY!” Bendy shouted while dodging each swing the jester threw at him which the jester didn’t listen until luckily a familiar voice then said “Jevil quit that, that’s one of are friends” which sure enough the jester known to be Jevil stopped and looked over down the hall same with Bendy seeing it was Sans who did that who was coming down quickly as can see Baldi was behind but dealing with trying to lure a large COTS away the best he can. “Sans! There you are! Quick we need help trying to deal with this lady that's-” “Woah, first we could use help from Bendy, there's this Ezose guy that we are stuck dealing with that’s causing this magic stuff here and we got a bit of a COTS problem here too.” Sans interrupted Bendy from asking which Bendy seemed curious by, seeing a bit what’s going on which sure enough can see how Jevil charged at this massive COTS Baldi was luring away and attack it from behind but surely it wasn’t being easy on them lashing around and trying to get Jevil off their back so they won’t be attacked there which can see this Ezose guy walking up perhaps to use magic to get Jevil off but Sans quickly sent a blaster to knock Ezose back so they can have an upperhand. </p>

<p>“Looks like for both ends it’s quite a battle..” Brook spoke up, able to slightly see what's going on from the side she's on for the wall which can see Sans and Bendy look to Brook now trying to think of an idea of how to go abouts handling this then so both of them aren’t stuck like this. “We take the walls down first!” Bendy spoke up of an idea which yet both Brook and Sans looked to Bendy to elaborate more on it. “If we take these down, we can make them both clash then boom! We all can take them both on with ease!” Bendy explained a bit more of the idea which isn’t a bad idea, though Sans seemed a bit unsure of it. “Who knows if they would even fight Bendy, if anything we need one of them to use as a way to follow back to their universe or at least have an easier time of knowing where to go to get to it.” Sans explained what he thought of the matter which Bendy didn’t really consider, seeming to be thinking a bit again upon hearing it. “Well there is Nuqx, he expressed how he doesn’t mean harm so maybe can have them at least maybe help us out knowing where to go” Brook thought up which at least covers that bit since Sans didn’t disagree with it nor did Bendy who smiled hearing it having not considered that. “Great thinking! Alright then, Let’s get these walls down first and-” before Bendy can finish saying that got stopped by seeing Sonic crash from behind Brook into the wall seeming to be having a rough time fighting but quickly got back up and looked to see what’s going on. </p>

<p>“Hey, could use help here by now, Clubtacka here is only getting more aggressive by the second!” Sonic complained a bit which yet surely means they got a time limit to get this done and fast before it gets worse. “We will in a second! Look we’re gonna get this wall down first so that way this all becomes easier for us so come on! Let’s get these walls down!” Bendy quickly encouraged, beginning to head to where the madness is for Sans, Baldi and whoever Jevil is dealing with to help out with that as Sonic looked at Brook a bit confused but Brook gave a look to reassure that this plan should work, it would have to after all. Till quickly as they stood quickly Clubtacka was charing down the hall both Sonic and Brook dodging as Mugman looks down it trying to shoot at Clubtacka the best he could while doing so, but Clubtacka seemed unbothered by it quickly swinging rapidly at them again which Sonic helped out Brook to move away from them seeing Clubtacka then hit the invisible wall they were near with a few swings at it till seeming to notice and study it while Sonic and Brook moved away to where Mugman was. </p>

<p>It’s hard to tell what Clubtacka saw next, seeming annoyed now as if seeing something that made them annoyed trying to swing at the invisible wall with their club a lot before being shot back from the magic that comes from it into the wall, seeming it annoyed them more for that. Which Brook signaled to Sonic and Mugman to follow her as they quickly began to leave Clubtacka distracted at the wall right now to try and get it down while they look to see if there's another opening or perhaps a way to somewhat assist to get these walls down. But quickly Mugman stopped them before going further before gesturing to the hall ahead of them. “Nuqx went down there, I don’t know what would happen if we went down that way. I am not sure if we’d be able to go back after that since Nuqx may get scared and use their powers!” Mugman spoke up worried if that was a good idea which left for a moment of thinking after that on where to go and surely had to be quick before Clubtacka realizes they went somewhere else and must handle them first. “I got this then! You go ahead!” Sonic reassured that he can do this going onwards to find where Nuqx taking in the direction Mugman knew they were in which hopefully he’d be okay if so then for that, which Brook and Mugman then began to check if there's a way to get to the rest to help or to see if there's a way to encourage the invisible walls to go down. Getting to one of them which Mugman ran a bit into being startled by it and confused by it since he was one the ones to not really know of it but gave a view to see a bit what Baldi, Sans, Jevil and Bendy were dealing with for trying this plan of sorts to get Ezose to put the magic walls down. </p>

<p>Can see how each of them were tricking Ezose into using magic towards them but making them hit the larger COTS that’s there who was taking them and wasn’t as affected but the more the effects stacked onto it the more the COTS became a situation but the plan was getting somewhere for that. Till eventually this large COTS when hit with another started getting everyone to back away from it knocking them all far as it tried to charge at them but quickly Mugman reacted fast when seeing this to whistle it over, causing its intention to avert to where Mugman and Brook is to try and help Sans, Baldi, Jevil and Bendy to not be hurt which the COTS came charging over and hit right into the invisible wall they’re at, then beginning to try and destroy it fast now as much as possible since it couldn’t reach them. “HAHA! NICE THINKING YOU TWO!” Bendy shouted in excitement upon seeing this as quickly Jevil then began to charge at Ezose to attack now as to start encouraging them to attack which Ezose began to throw more magic at them which at least each of them dodged and can hit and make this COTS grow to be an issue. But, this time it wasn’t to there advantage seeing it then when hit again once Baldi and Sans lured another attack to hit it, caused it to be able to break through the wall breaking this invisible wall it seems and nearly hitting both Brook and Mugman but Brook was able to react fast enough and make them move, that wasn’t exactly the plan but surely isn’t good that is for sure. </p>

<p>The COTS took another swing but quickly can see Jevil hop over it and block the attack with there scythe from hitting them as they quickly threw suits into the face of it before swinging at it rapidly to keep it backed off while laughing maniacally as they did which at least they got saved there. Though a moment of relief sure isn’t to last long as Sonic came dashing over just dodging Clubtacka whos swing hit into the wall meaning they must’ve got done with the wall now and are trying to rapidly hurt them, quickly all having to dodge as Clubtacka charges again but this time hitting the COTS down and into the wall then vanishing like a shadow from the impact which Jevil had to dodge with but laughed at the sight of seeing that happen before having to dodge swings now from Clubtacka. Though quickly Sans and Bendy came turning down from the hall further in seeing how they’re dodging magic attacks thrown by Ezose, which quickly both managing to dodge and make one of them hit into Clubtacka and sure enough caused Clubtacka to go down, which caused Ezose to pause and realize what they done before Baldi quickly caught them from behind seeming to throw down this gum of sorts as a trap keeping them there. </p>

<p>“AND THAT'S HOW WE DO IT!” Bendy exclaimed after all of that in joy as everyone did celebrate a bit now from that. Though quickly had to pause it when Jevil began to try and swing at Bendy who was nearby but Sans blocked it with a bone, right, going to need some proper introductions by chance now with this. But before that can be done can hear Clubtacka found a way back up seeming to have some trick to endure it though it’s clear they weren’t happy and as everyone readied Clubtacka went past everyone and right to Ezose seeming clearly very angry at him. “WHY. DID YOU. HIT. ME!??” Clubtacka shouted at Ezose  preparing there club perhaps to plan to hit them but didn’t which Ezose tried to back away but couldn’t due to being stuck in the gum, “Look Clubtacka, I wasn’t trying to aim for you-” “SHUT UP I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO TRY AND CHANGE THE TOPIC YOU DEFORMED SQUARE! TELL ME WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HIT ME!?” Clubtacka shouted again interrupting Ezose from talking which yet by surprise they actually are distracted talking to each other, so this gives the group a chance now to try and find Nuqx to get some answers for the time being so that way can get back to them and see if they can deal with them first off. So the group quietly began to leave now, Jevil tried to go in and charge at them but quickly Baldi this time pulled Jevil back so they went on, hearing the shouting as they went to go searching for Nuqx and maybe make sense on well what’s happened since then, though as they got farther, can hear suddenly a loud crash as they went, making the whole group pause and look back in curiosity. What was that?</p>

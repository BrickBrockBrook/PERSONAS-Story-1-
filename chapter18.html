<h2>Chapter 18. Safety</h2>

<p>The group was being careful and sneaky as they watched Luradis and Solgo far ahead going by some spots seeing Luradis try and instruct Solgo to do stuff like move something in the way or check out one of the buildings, which the group began to follow quietly behind for making sure to hide at some chances so they won’t risk being spotted by them or anything else around as some of the group searched for hints of where people could be hiding which so far no clues at all, just a chaos left around for the most part surely. There has to be some clue somewhere, just the question of where. As they soon followed, once checking one the areas Sans was quick to hear a knocking on the wall which interrupted the conversation Sans was having with Mugman about this matter, which they looked to it, the knocking was in some odd pattern but not exactly one, some of the knocks short and some of them long. Mugman quickly walked to the wall it was heard from and spoke up loud enough for whoever is on the other side to hear but not loud enough to be caught currently. </p>

<p>“Hello? Is someone there?” Mugman asked which only more knocks responded, which it seems it’s trying to communicate, but nobody understands what they’re saying, except Baldi seems to have an idea on what’s being said. “That’s morse code. We won’t be able to hear them but they can hear us just enough, hang on ask it something.” Baldi looked to Mugman going to the wall to listen in which everyone watched though Sans and Bendy kept watch a bit to make sure they aren’t far from where Luradis and Solgo were which luckily they stopped though not lucky for how Luradis got the big brute COTS to destroy a few buildings here and there. “Are you okay behind there?” Mugman asked, hearing knocks in return to it in some kind of pattern which Baldi was taking the time to process, then looked to Mugman to translate. “They answered with ‘We’re all okay behind here, is this Mugman speaking or that mean person from before?’.” Baldi translated which Mugman got excited once hearing that news, his family must be there then. “Yes! This is Mugman speaking! I’m here with some friends I made where we are all here to help!” Mugman spoke excitedly hoping there could be some way to the other side to see if everyone was there. Knocks responded back when Baldi took a moment to figure what’s being said then looked at Mugman “ ‘Mugman? You're okay! That’s great news, we’ll get the door open for you in a second, please wait there with your friends.’. Guess we wait now.” Baldi after translating looked away from Mugman to the rest which really brought exciting news for everybody. Things are going smoothly. </p>

<p>They just have to wait and keep hidden and surely hope no danger comes this way which so far the danger that is there is distracted with breaking many buildings on the farest side. “This is great! We found them! Now we can make sure they get to safety!” Mugman spoke with excitement though kept it down in case so no dangers could risk hearing them. “Then we get to handle that no good person just like how we did with the previous ones!” Bendy added getting excited as he looked at Mugman with a confident ready smile while Sans was stuck being the one doing more the watching. “This is oddly going too smoothly..” Baldi spoke up, questioning things for if it’s really going that well, which got everyone questioning too, something has to be up, but who knows what, though yet everyone did quietly prepare. Soon can see the wall seem to slowly move like it's being pushed to the side which everyone moved away from incase something bad occurs but yet it revealed an entrance through, which yet means Baldi must've been right in translating since can see a unfamiliar but kind face shown themselves and was quick to talking, “Welcome! I can tell you surely are all a friendly bunch, now hurry in, it's not safe out there and we don't want to be caught” this friendly person said offering them to come in but then Sans spoke up as everyone was going to do so. “Shouldn’t someone stay out to keep watch perhaps? In case anything happens by chance?” After that was said everyone paused to consider such a thing, what if they do need someone to keep watch to make sure these bad people don't get far or get close? Someone has to, just a matter of who. “I'll do it! I'll keep watch! I will do so as much as possible and if anything happens I have a quick way in to get you guys anyways!” Bendy was quick to speak up, not afraid to do so, which everyone thought and didn't have any counters though it was a worry for a few but they all can trust him. “Please be careful Bendy” Brook spoke up looking at Bendy while Mugman and Baldi went in first but Sans waited for Brook to come along. “Don't worry, I will be, okay?” Bendy looked to Brook giving a reassuring smile which did help be sure he'd be alright before Brook went in now and so did Sans once Brook went in as Bendy now kept watch as he heard this door of sorts close again. The now smaller-ish group walked on into this unknown area as this person leaded able to tell it is rocky at first but then got nice and smooth and more like a building that seems like a safe place to go to which yet Mugman seemed to begin to recognize and was sure it was safe for what one can tell while Baldi and Sans studied the place and Brook focused on everyone and following this unknown friendly face. </p>

<p>Soon they reached into an area that was open and had a lot of families in there worried but caring for one another as some have calmed but some are still worried of the outside dangers, which once in can see Mugman thank the friendly face who allowed them to head in perhaps to explore and Mugman was quick to searching around for his family in here, which Sans and Baldi began to try and search to see if anyone knew by chance where they are asking around which Brook followed Mugman to help him through some the crowds to see if they’re around at all, then Mugman noticed them quickly rushing over while shouting “Grandpa Kettle!” seeing this older cartoon like kettle of sorts notice Mugman and welcomed him in with a hug which they hugged one another though it didn’t appear his brothers were around but yet Brook quickly signaled to Sans and Baldi where they are which they came over to see what’s going on now. “Mugman! Oh you're okay… we got so worried about you, you're not too hurt now right? This Elderly Kettle asked, which Mugman smiled upon hearing that. “I may have broken my handle a little but it’s okay! It doesn’t hurt so bad! But… Elder Kettle, where is Cuphead and Cugieco?...” Mugman asked, growing worried now as he checked around a bit for any sign of them at all, which got the rest of the group worried a bit here even seeing how Elder Kettle had a more worried, saddened look now. “Cugieco fell into a portal soon after you which made Cuphead go into a portal to try and look for you both since he was so worried, but he helped get me and a lot of everyone else here before he went to do so… I’m sorry Mugman.” </p>

<p>Elder Kettle answered looking upset which can tell Mugmans expression really saddened away from his usual cheery look he had, his brothers are missing too, that yet was clear he cares for a lot. Which made everyone worried even can tell with Sans, can tell Sans was really thinking about it a lot, seeing him then go over to where Mugman was and moved a bit lower to Mugmans level which Mugman noticed and mentioned to Elder Kettle to excuse them for a second as he looked to Sans still with a saddened look. “Mugman, Don’t worry now. Look I'm sure they should be okay, if you know your brothers like how I know my brother, is that they’re strong and will be okay, but right now, you’ve got to as well despite this, okay? Besides if you’re still willing to help, we can all try to put a stop to this.” Sans talked to Mugman to reassure him about this, which Mugman listened in before giving a small smile as it motivated him a bit now for the belief that they can do this and just turned this sadness to some motivator just giving Sans a quick hug now saying a bit of a quick “Thank you” before he let go and looked to Elder Kettle now, just becoming a little more cheery again but also more motivated in some way now too. “Oh how you got the confidence of your father… Please be careful of each of you, but if you need anything I’ll be here.” Elder Kettle smiled glad to see Mugman get that confidence again now all because of Sans helping which is nice of him to do, which looking at him can tell he seems a bit happier once helping Mugman out with that, guess Sans really is coming around now. Baldi after watching looked at Brook now. “Would be a good idea to let everyone know now they would need to move further to safety.” Baldi told Brook who nodded, then looked to Sans and Mugman and even to Elder Kettle who was nearby. “Alright, we should start telling people to move, there is a danger that is outside of here that could find everyone here any minute and we can’t allow that, so one of us should find if there's some space further in that's safer to go to and the rest start getting everyone to know and get going to there.” Brook spoke up which they nodded which seems Elder Kettle knew a spot and asked for Mugman to come with to see if it will do which Mugman agreed and they both got to that, then the rest studied the crowd and Baldi asked for Sans to summon something he could stand on to be higher up, which Sans summoned a platform of bones allowing Baldi to step onto and be raised up above everyone which everyone seemed to notice and look confused and worried now, while Brook kept watch for if Mugman would get back. “Attention everyone here. There is a danger lurking nearby outside and Me along with a few others will wish to assist you to a further safe area so you won’t be in any risk of harm.” </p>

<p>Baldi spoke up which listening to it sounds he is familiar with speaking to big groups of people, almost like a teacher to think, which yet Brook noticed Mugman come back with Elder Kettle giving a thumbs up to indicate they found an area which Brook looked to Baldi and gestured to him a spot has been found that works. Baldi took note and everyone was worriedly talking in the crowd who yet paid attention to what Baldi had to say. “Now Mugman, Me and a few others will be escorting you to the new safer spot. Please make sure you stick together, keep quiet and be quick so we won’t waste any time and risk the danger getting here. That’s all I have to say now.” Baldi finished it up which everyone nodded along getting into proper groups and some going to where they saw Mugman which made more people follow in a line sort of formation where Mugman began to lead now, during this Sans lowered Baldi back down onto the ground seeing Baldi get off the platform and looked to Sans and Brook now. “That was simple. Alright, Each of us should each get some people split into sections so we each can handle one, that should increase efficiency so Mugman can lead the sections to the place.” Baldi explained which both Sans and Brook nodded as Baldi went to most of the people waiting and asked for some of the groups to come with him while seeming to explain to them how Sans and Brook are helping. Sans went over after and began to get one together in some way though not having that loud of a voice since most of the group didn’t notice but paid attention either way.  </p>

<p>Brook then went over and got the leftover people together and began to make sure everyone had someone making sure to speak loud so all of them could hear, waiting for Mugman to get back so each section can go one at a time, Mugman was quick to get back and which Brook went first to bring a group over as Mugman took them now which Brook went to the one Sans was at helping Sans out with getting things together while Baldi was able to handle his pretty easily. Soon Sans and Brook had to bring over that section to Mugman which Mugman was quick to handling in some way, which to notice he seems more confident in some way doing so, it’s a feeling he is less worried to think which is nice to see, while once Sans and Brook got that handled and were going to Baldi can hear a loud crashing noise from overhead now for where there in, which the last section was panicking upon hearing it as Baldi tried to keep everybody calm which Brook went over to help as Sans was checking around for hints where the sound came from even checking the way they came in to see if Bendy would come in to inform them what’s going on. Which sure enough Bendy came rushing in out from a puddle and over to them quickly going to where they saw Sans seeing them and just had a quickened breath once he stopped and looked to Sans then the rest for who he saw. “They… Are attacking here now, It seemed that Solgo knew where and that bad person Lura-dees or something like that figured out she were lying and- now they are using that large brute COTS to try and get in” Bendy spoke quickly which made the one section more worried which Baldi kept trying to calm same with Brook which both listened in and looked worried hearing it, that’s not good, they got to be quick. “Alright, I’ll get Mugman quickly back here then.” Sans spoke but as he was going to go Baldi quickly stopped him and looked at the section. “No, I will take them there. Okay, Everyone, follow me closely, I’ll get us there, stick close and don’t trail behind.” Baldi instructed everyone quickly which everyone began to follow Baldi who seems to memorize a bit where Mugman must’ve went during all those trips, which left Brook, Sans and Bendy to watch as Baldi went to do so, now these three got to keep watch in case any danger tries to break in, they got to be ready here after all. Otherwise who knows what’ll happen. “Any plans on how we’d go abouts fighting them?” Sans asked which Brook and Bendy looked to one another then Sans, does he not have a plan this time around? They got to figure something, which Bendy seemed to have one that could either be good or a little much. “We go at them with all we got!” </p>

<p>Bendy answered which Sans looked at Bendy not thinking that was a good idea as it wasn’t the safest really or who even knows what any of them are capable of aside from having some ideas which Sans surely expressed how it sounded a bad idea for what Bendy said by just giving a look of uncertainty. “That doesn’t sound the safest.” Sans now responded which Bendy looked to him confused how it isn’t a good idea but before words could be said back and forth that’s when the place suddenly had another loud crash noise that shook the place even some small bits of rubble fell down from around, it seems there progress of breaking in is working, they needed a plan fast and which can see Baldi and Mugman come back after having got everyone to safety, the group is all here they all need to figure something. “What are we going to do??” Mugman asked as he came over looking around to see if anything was going to come down on them at all while Baldi followed behind checking a bit around too. “Well I thought we could-” “We aren’t going full force, that isn’t safe.” Sans interrupted Bendy who just sighed after being interrupted when he was going to say his idea, so it left everyone to think up a plan. Brook watched as everyone thought and glanced back to where abouts the door was, she was thinking too, what would they even throw at them after all, what dangers would all of them face against? </p>

<h5>She will stay, They will flee…</h5>

<p>A voice echoed in her head again. What does that mean? It has to mean something, perhaps… “There's only one of them fighting us.” Brook spoke up which everyone looked to her confused now, it’s clear they all want an answer on what Brook means. “Brook, what do you mean?” Baldi asked which everyone seems to clearly have that same question, how is she to explain it? There has to be a reason it could be she can’t really just tell them she has some feeling or some voice told her… Just got to think logically about it. “Well, we’ve seen how it has worked so far, Solgo clearly doesn’t want to fight us it seems, that large brute COTS has been doing most the attacking and destroying while Luradis just commands it and hasn’t done any of it herself, so it has to be that it’s just the COTS we’re all against then. Least, that’s what I think…” Brook wasn’t confident but did explain and as everyone thought for a moment Bendy was quick to process it and smiled upon hearing it. “It’s gotta be then! That seems far too likely! I mean come on, for all the things Brook has figured out during this journey I’m sure she has to be right at least even with the possibility of having to only fight one!” Bendy was quick to approve of it clearly which got Mugman in on it now seeming confident it could be that too. “Yeah! That sounds right! Which we got this if it’s just that COTS! Come on, we handled a bird COTS before, a smaller brute COTS and a spider COTS!” Mugman spoke up with a smile as he looked at everyone, to which Baldi began to agree a bit with this now due to some of the points mentioned after considering them a bit. Which Sans was taking it in more but then agreed with, which is good that everyone did believe and agree with, which means there’s now a more prepared mindset amongst everyone, but yet before now proper planning could begin the place shook and a louder crash was heard, it sounds there close to breaking in completely now, they all needed to prepare and fast. “Okay, Let’s keep this simple, Bendy and Baldi you go near the entrance, Mugman you take the side and I’ll take the other, Brook you take the front, if we can just bait it to go to Brook for a bit we’d be able to get it from every other side.” Sans quickly said some kind of method he had thought up which Bendy was quick to get into position and same with Mugman, though Baldi wanted to consider more ideas for it. “What if our attacks aren’t enough now? It would be smart to set up some kind of trap for it to fall into if it gets closer.” Baldi asked which Sans had to think for a moment, which Mugman overheard from the spot he’s at and was quick to throw in a creative idea of his. “Oh! Oh! We can use Sans’s bones for that COTS to trip!” </p>

<p>Mugman answered for Sans which Sans seemed alright with that idea, surely seems like everyone's thinking was being put right into this as Baldi, Sans and Brook got to their sides, right when Brook got into position that’s when there was a much louder crash and shake around hearing what sounds like rocks break and completely open up away where the entrance is seeing some smaller rocks roll down from there, that answers that now, surely this is going to become a fight now.  Which can hear people walking towards and which Brook watched everyone prepare more but yet Brook stood in a spot capable of being able to see them, able to see Luradis lead and Solgo trail behind but- it looks like that large brute COTS waited outside? Why? Which yet made her try to pass a look over to one of the rest in the room which it seems Bendy was watching Brook so she was able to pass it to him who it seems he managed to pass to the rest, which means who knows how this will go down but yet can see Luradis look right to Brook and had a smile. “Well Well Well! Looks Like this is the hiding place and one failed to get away! Oh poor girl, Don’t worry mrs, we’ll help you out” Luradis laughed a bit as she walked to Brook but stopped once entered the room, like they were figuring things out but it’s hard to tell, which yet they looked to Solgo now. “Solgo, You know what to do, oh, also be sure to not damage that necklace this lady has on, I’m sure Balaur would love to see it” Luradis chuckled but Solgo didn’t seem to want to listen, Solgo looked a bit at Luradis but focused on Brook. </p>

<p>Though looking at Solgo can tell Solgo was worried about Brook and clearly doesn’t want to hurt them while as well Solgo looked confused why Brook was alone, which is confusing how they both haven’t noticed everyone else but then again seems everyone else was keeping in spots that made them kind of hidden. “Solgo. You don’t want to wind up like Stiex with those horrible injuries, even with that massive one now, do we? Get to it.” Luradis demanded Solgo, not smiling but glaring at Solgo who was more hesitant, she clearly doesn’t want to hurt Brook, There has to be something one can do before this gets bad. “Why can’t you?” Brook spoke up looking to Luradis, trying to be brave during this which Luradis snapped to look at Brook not suspecting it clearly for Brook to speak up, in which they began to walk over to Brook now, which can see Solgo looked more worried upon that, Brook watched as Luradis walked closer and closer to Brook not saying a word which made Brook begin to worry, but as Luradis took a few more steps, suddenly bones shot out from in front of Luradis to trip her and fast which yet can see Bendy and Baldi quickly charge at Luradis, Baldi getting there first to get Luradis to stay down and Bendy to secure them staying down for good. </p>

<p>Sans and Mugman came out from hiding too, Sans going in between Luradis and Brook while can see Mugman rush over to Solgo perhaps to check if they’re okay from all of this. “AGH! YOU BASTARDS! GET OFF OF ME BEFORE I-” “Quiet down.” Baldi interrupted Luradis’s yelling as Bendy pushed Luradis head a bit into the ground to quiet her down. Mugman came over now once it seems he was able to reassure Solgo a bit just looking at everyone and seemed curious if they managed to get through this now. “Did we do it?” Mugman asked, to which everyone began to question which Bendy was quick to think they did clearly since he had a smile on his face. “Hell yeah we did! TAKE THAT!” Bendy shouted at the end towards Luradis who yet didn’t respond but yet soon had a small chuckle, which made everything go quiet, then another small chuckle, till it grew to be even more, this doesn’t seem good. “You all are such idiots.” Luradis laughed, seeming to reach into one of her sleeves which Bendy went to stop but she got hold of it before Bendy can do anything taking out this device and pressing the button before it anyone can take it away which yet appeared did nothing, but checking around can see Solgo seemed to be hurting due to it, seeing Mugman dash over to see if Solgo was okay, same with Sans who seemed to go over to make sure Mugman won’t be hurt, which Baldi winded up joining while Bendy and Brook kept an eye on Luradis who only stayed there laughing. </p>

<p>“Solgo?? You okay??” Mugman asked Solgo for what can be heard which Solgo struggled during this trying to stay far from Mugman, Sans and Baldi once they got closer, which Baldi and Sans looked to one another during this not sure what to do while Mugman tried to move closer, whilst this happened Bendy was getting upset and looked at Luradis making sure they can’t escape. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER??” Bendy yelled at Luradis which Luradis only laughed more upon hearing that. Brook went over to try and get the device from Luradis which she got hold of quickly before Luradis could do anything but it seems Luradis didn’t care as Brook studied it doesn’t look as though there was much option to stop it which worried Brook seeing Solgo still struggle while Mugman, Sans and Baldi try to figure some way to help. “YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO HELP HIM! The genius that made this made sure it will not stop till he changes form into the beast he is!” Luradis laughed more which Bendy was getting annoyed, taking the device from Brook forgetting about Luradis just shoving them far into the wall, figuring a way to open the back of the device and begins to try and mess around with what’s in there, which Brook watched Luradis and the Solgo situation growing worried about this whole ordeal and even on what to do here. </p>

<h5>Watch Out</h5>

<p>Is what echoed through her head again, causing her to look to Luradis who didn’t do anything but then saw Solgo which seems something was happening seeing a darkness come from around them, causing Brook to dash over to the rest and shout “WATCH OUT!” Which everyone quickly moved back while Mugman didn’t entirely but Brook ran over to pull Mugman away quickly seeing then what looks like these now darkness of ropes that are pitch black shoot out from everywhere and almost piercing everyone but everyone luckily had dodged it all, guess the change form thing makes sense now since Solgo doesn’t seem to be the same anymore. Though can check it damaged the device that caused this seeing how it shot out from Bendys hand which Bendy who stood very still looked to see everyone and saw Brook looking to him, he can get through this for everyones stuck having to stay still otherwise who knows if they could be hurt by this which seems Baldi did accidentally touch for a second and seemed it stinged. Bendy then quickly and carefully melted into a puddle into the ground and can see him going through which everyone seemed to be trying to figure out some way or hoping Bendy can do something for seems Mugman noticed and Brook was already aware of it. Seeing the puddle below where this Solgo was seeing Bendy quickly shoot out and throw them to the ground causing all these darkness of ropes retract as she fell, though can see how their eyes are just a white glow and all of them was darkness as they looked at Bendy and the rest, getting up again except, seems it was dark intention, which everyone moved away from upon seeing this. Till heard Luradis begin to laugh as they walk over to where Solgo is having such an evil-like smile upon her face. “Looks like it truly does work! Perfect! Now Solgo, go on and show them your power and destroy these little rats trying to get in the way of our progress! I’m going to go ahead and get to the next spot ahead! Have fun!~” Luradis said with a playful almost tone at the end that had not good intentions seeing Luradis begin to leave as Solgo seemed to listen seeing the ropes come out from there back which seems there was multiple, meaning everyone had to try and fight them now, this isn’t good, they all got to do something, so it really is one person to fight though, but they got this, they all do, so can see everyone ready themselves as then Bendy shouted with confidence and already ready to fight, “Alright! LET’S WIN THIS FIGHT!” </p>

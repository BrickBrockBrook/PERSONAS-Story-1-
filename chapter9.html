<h2>Chapter 9. Cheeky Amaranth Fellow</h2>

<p>A new environment, new colors all around, a new feeling, a new member and a new foot into this adventure. They are yet in a new place completely, a whole other universe that could be universes away from home for all is to know or maybe closer than one suspects, but how is Brook to know? She looked to everything around looking for all the details she could see about this place, surely it seems it is quite a magical place and the sky was full of darkness but portals opening to thousands of other universes one cannot yet reach. Why does the ground feel like a carpet to even wonder or why are the trees here all so red and magenta like? Why is the grass a bright purple with no weeds or flowers to grow out from it? Why does this universe make her look all so different? Various questions with so little answers and various details her artsy eyes could yet see. But at least she isn’t alone for she has made some friends along the way to aid her in this journey to stop this, hoping to not lose a single one in the very process of this or hurt any of them as well. </p>

<p>“So who even are these brothers, Mugman?? Like their names and stuff like that!” Bendy asked while walking up to walk along with Mugman to listen for their answer while Brook quietly watched while Sans focused on going ahead. “Oh! Well they are wonderful people my brothers, my brother Cuphead may be a bit extreme sometimes but he is the best. As my other brother Cugieco is really sweet and nice although very quiet to new people, maybe you can meet them some day!” Mugman smiled to that, explaining happily a bit on his brothers which Bendy listened in curiously it surely does seem. “So, what is it like having- well- family?” “Hold on, Bendy, how do you not have family?” Sans said once hearing Bendy ask that to Mugman, which made everyone's focus go onto Bendy now, which Bendy looked at everyone in slight confusion to it. “Wait, so we all aren’t just kinda created from some machine or paper stuff???” Bendy said in confusion which made everyone give a bit of a concerned and worried look to Bendy, how is it he does not have a family is the wonder or at least even knows them. </p>

<p>“Bendy, how do you think we come into this world, dare I ask?” Sans spoke up, looking to Bendy who seemed to look at Sans then to the rest of them then to Brook for a bit then to Sans finally with an answer. “Well I do know there is a different way humans do I think but I thought everyone else just kinda came from a machine?” Bendy explained which everyone kind of looked to one another now which Bendy watched as they all did, which is a worry but hey let’s save it for another time maybe. “Don’t worry Bendy, look even then you’re not left out of anything here, can explain it to you when the chance comes, okay?” Brook explained going over to Bendy to reassure him a bit better by patting his shoulder and looking to him, which he seemed to stare right back not suspecting it but yet smiled once got such a nice gesture like that not feeling ashamed for not knowing because of this, can’t blame him for it after all it probably just was how life was back at his universe for where he is or that wasn’t taught correctly at all by anyone such a thing like that. </p>

<p>“Thanks..” Bendy said, till then can hear screaming from somewhere, the sound of people being in fear and running from somewhere, which made the four all look to where it was heard, danger. Brook began to lead the way towards it right away running to where she believes the source is with the rest following right after her quickly to try and keep up with where she is headed, hearing the screams flee from somewhere but can hear screams from within a odd tent of some kind ahead that had the writing SHOP above it figuring that must be where the source is, heading right towards it without fear. Quickly once near watched as someone ran out screaming and hearing someone inside go “Aww what’s the matter sexy?~ Too scared to have some fun?~” which made Brook look in with some worry now but stepped in anyways for shouldn’t be scared now for anything. Which while entering was yet spotted by whoever was in there standing on the counter of this shop looking full of antiques and weapons and other sorts of things but it’s been wrecked with it seems perhaps due to this odd someone on the counter wearing what appears like a jester hat covering there eyes that had a black and amaranth colored side and the bells on it are replaced with pink hearts and the outfit looked as though almost like a lab coat being a burnt burgundy color of some kind with pink scar like patterns around it, it appeared they even had elf ears that were the color of there pastel pink skin with gloves and boots a bruised burgundy color that they wore dark gray pants and a long amaranth tail shaped like a hook at the end, in which the person had a toothy grin that had a natural light yellow coloration to it. </p>

<p>“Oh my, my, my!~ What a sexy gal to walk in without a sign of fear!~ Oh it’s a wonder if what I can do get you screaming like you are though~” The amaranth person said, hopping off the counter and going towards Brook which made Brook back away in regret for entering the shop but backed up right into someone, making her kind of stop to try to look but they stepped in front of her quickly to guard which was Bendy thankfully. “HEY! DON’T GO TRYNA HURT HER!” “Oooo~ And look at you!~ Being such a brick wall for her makes me wonder what would happen if one breaks it~” The amaranth person said which made Bendy look confused and concerned in some way for must be quite the surprise to hear such a thing like that. Then can hear the other two come over able to hear Sans is tired out while Mugman was looking at Sans then now to Bendy, Brook and this amaranth person with curiosity to what could be going on. “Uhm… What is going on? Who is this pers-” “Ooo~ A little mug or cup~ And I would surely love to get a drink of some of you to see what you’re filled with~” The amaranth person said going towards Mugman which Mugman looked and backed a bit away using his cloak a bit to protect themselves for if this person does attempt anything of sorts. </p>

<p>“Mmm~ And who is this sexy fella in the jacket?~""Yeah no, back away jester, not into these jests here.” Sans said back at this Amaranth person moving away from them seeming a bit annoyed by this just sticking by the rest making it clear he trusts them more then this person. “Oh you can call me Alovo~ But you can call me whatever you like you big b-” “HOLD ON- FIRST OF ALL ARE YOU WORKING WITH THESE BAD PEOPLE THAT GOT THOSE COTS OUTSIDE?? ARE YOU WORKING FOR SOMEONE ALOVO??? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HUH??” Bendy said interrupting the amaranth person known as Alovo who was talking, going over to them with no fear and getting hold of the collar of his top in some way, lifting them up to be eye level to him and not having to look down at this guy. “Oooo~ I enjoy this treatment~ Much better then others around here for how they treat everyone in such fun disguises to go with the mischievous look~” Alovo spoke back finding more of a pleasure in Bendys actions in which Bendy seemed to be more figuring what he meant very much from it like figuring some riddle, in which could be perhaps them trying to say something and Brook yet figured it out.</p>

<p>“So there is another one here with you? Who?? Are they bad?” Brook spoke up, looking to Alovo not too afraid of him probably because Bendy was there to keep guard. “Mmmm~ Well hold me harder first~” “ANSWER HER QUESTION!” Bendy yelled a bit at Alovo, seeming to be quite defensive, probably to be sure Brook is safe from this guy. “Ohh you know~ You will know it once you see there inventive attitude~ Ohh how they could treat some like such playful toys oh how fun that is~ Makes me wonder if you guys can be my toys too~” Alovo spoke, using his tail to bring Bendys head close having a mischievous look on his face that didn’t seem to change really all that much which made Bendy weirded out by dropping Alovo and moving away but more to where Brook is to keep her safe from this very odd guy. Someone else is doing this? Who though? Quite the question everyone must be having right now. </p>

<p>“What’s their name then sir??” Mugman spoke up, looking to where Alovo is which Alovo looked to Mugman going over to get close but quickly Sans moved Mugman further away to be a bit of assistance for keeping the majority of them safe from this unique guy. “Ohh he can go by many~ Maddy?~ Sciencey?~ Evil?~ Villain?~ Oh the list goes on but my favorite is-""THAT DOESN’T ANSWER OUR QUESTION!” Bendy shouted at Alovo who didn’t give a clear answer exactly, which then again brought more questions. Why can’t he give a clear answer, like they are stuck in this behavior or they are being forced to act this way? There has to be a reason, right? But that cannot be answered right away now for then seems Alovo looked to Bendy then to Brook quickly having a grin that only got worse appearing in some way they got an idea, perhaps a bad one at that, causing Bendy nearby to notice it quickly and step in front of Brook quickly to protect her not scared of Alovo at all in any way. </p>

<p>“HEY! IF YOU’RE PLANNING TO HURT HER JUST KNOW I WON’T LET THAT HAPPEN!” Bendy shouted at Alovo, while looking at Alovo can see his expression didn’t change at all or his thought process it seems, like he wasn’t listening now. Studying him just trying to find a new detail perhaps a hint for if there is anything to be seen can see a slight movement of his mouth perhaps moving a way that was like he said a number so quietly that nobody can hear before then charging at Bendy and Brook, which Bendy reacted fast charging back and about to hit Alovo down but Alovo swooped around them quickly going towards where Brook was making her having to react fast, think fast for one has to do something quickly before he does his plan, maybe something to help him for how he seemed he was counting down like he hears counting and something is coming if it reaches zero that he seems aware of but they aren’t. </p>

<p>Brook quickly moved to the side seeing Alovo miss but turn to look to her again studying around, making Brook back up into a spot in this place that felt like a door, listening in to it though can hear the silent fear of others that could be hiding in there, in which made her open the door to go help till Alovo began charging again making her open it and move aside quickly to not get caught in what he could be planning. Brook looked to the door ready to go in and stop it but the door closed on her perhaps from Alovo himself, odd, why would he close it when he was- oh no he is after those people stuck in there. “Are you okay??” Bendy said, going over to check Brook, which Brook looked to Bendy quickly then to the door, thinking of the words to say. “He was counting… But I don’t get why he would be co-” when Brook was saying that they can hear screaming from the other side but can hear Alovo talking but it sounded more like his voice was rising for counting. </p>

<p>Ten…nine… eight… the sound of panic in there gets louder, which then the focus switched away when Bendy got Brook by the wrist quickly but being gentle to pull her away and began to gesture for Sans and Mugman to come along quickly to leave the shop, almost like he became aware of the stress of hearing it all can be and didn’t want the rest to get very stressed by such a thing which was quite nice of him to do even so. Till all were outside and the fear inside was less now, which seemed though it frightened a few of them, seeing how Mugman was shaking from the fear of hearing that, Sans having a look where it shaken him up but is focusing on reassuring Mugman, but yet Bendy seemed- not to phased, he looked a little bothered but he just seemed to not fear it, unless he was deep down. “Is everyone okay?..” Brook said, a little shaken up as well by it but for some reason she isn’t as much which confuses her a bit how she isn’t. </p>

<p>“Well despite us being scared, why would you have lured him there? That puts those people in danger, Brook.” Sans said, looking at Brook having a serious look on his face, one that seems he is angry in some way. “I wasn’t trying to I-...” “She was just as scared Sans! Don’t give her crap for doing that! Plus how was she to know that guy would go after those people she didn’t even know were in there! Even then I think she had figured something out because she saw him counting and thinking that through it could have a meaning to it for that darkly weird guy to lash out like that! Infact for my knowledge, that means he could be getting controlled!” Bendy spoke up when Brook tried to say some things back, which made Brook look to Bendy hearing that surely not suspecting him to really try to defend her like that, quite relieves her to know she doesn’t have to deal with this alone. “So you’re going to let that slide both of you? Let slide people could be dying in there?” “GUYS QUIT FIGHTING!!..” Mugman shouted once Sans said what he said, which made everyone look at Mugman surprised by him shouting at all of them like that, quite unsuspected for someone so sweet. </p>

<p>“Look! I- I know we all have differences here and we are worried and scared but we shouldn’t fight over it, we got to work together! I’m sure Brook didn’t mean to at all and with what Bendy said it makes sense and even then I think we all feel bad and as they probably would’ve tried to stop it but- it can be scary to have to face things like that!... So please can we all try to understand that they didn’t mean to and should understand that it was too scary to try and do anything about it??..” Mugman explained which made everyone go silent, looking to one another even Sans looking to Bendy and Brook while Bendy and Brook looked back to Sans, they all gave fair reasons to all of this truly, just need to understand it which they in fact do now so no complaining there. “Sorry…” Brook spoke up now looking to Sans to apologize for what was all said, which Sans looked over hearing what was said and so did Bendy. </p>

<p>“It’s alright, I’m sorry as well.” “Yeah, sorry..” Sans said then Bendy added to it, which yet shows how each one of them is truly sorry for arguing and yet as well shows Mugman really did manage to calm everyone down to realize they all shouldn’t argue like that, quite lucky to have him now a part of the group. “There we go! Now we can all hug it out and-” “We’re not doing that.” Sans interrupted what Mugman was saying, which made Mugman startled a bit by it but then nodded his head in understanding now, at least now they are all getting along again. Then can check back to the shop seeing how the shop looked all so normal on the outside but yet can hear the faint screams from within it that yet can cause a quiet stress for some of them to hear such a thing like that, poor people who got caught in that, but must’ve been a reasoning to why the guy acted out in such a way like that now. </p>

<p>Then that very guy, Alovo, came right outside seeming to have handled such a thing and grinned at the group that same face he had on the whole time for it’s clear he had noticed the group there, coming right over to them, which made Bendy act fast to stand in front of everyone right away. “WHAT DID YOU DO TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU CRAZY-” “Oooo~ Shouting!~ Oh such an activity like that is all so fun~ As I had to stop the clock so we can have all the time in the world~” Alovo interrupted Bendys yelling getting all so close to them which Bendy didn’t fear for he more so didn’t understand why Bendy did all so much, must be why he is so brave for all of this. “Wh- Wait What do you mean by that now??” Brook spoke up, looking to Alovo who yet turned to look right back, trying to go over but Bendy blocked the way quickly. </p>

<p>“Mmmm~ So unfamiliar and yet a wonder what that could be like!~ Wonder if that can get me screaming answers if that’s what you prefer now~” Alovo said, trying to get close again but Bendy kept forcing him back each time he tried to go over. He doesn’t seem he can answer it but for the wording if forced he would but what if there is a danger to it, what if someone is listening in to all of this and he is aware of it but everyone else isn’t? Wanting to give the answers but how can he when he is always going to end up being told to do something before the timer starts for the time he has to do things, meaning if he doesn’t keep up he is going to be hurt, but right now seems they got some time to buy before then, before that timer starts right back up. They all could be on a timer if so then. “So, Alovo? This person you spoke of before who's crazy and such, what are they doing as of now?” Brook spoke up again, looking to Alovo figuring a way to respond that could hopefully let him answer a bit more clearly with, which does seem he had his focus on Brook but can tell he was getting urges. “Oooo~ Oh I bet they could be laughing away at someone for their little minds!~ Oh how that can be entertaining but nowhere near as entertaining as giving them a taste~” Alovo said, trying to get closer but Bendy moved him away again right away, it seems this person has thought ahead of this. </p>

<p>This person must go by the brains of things, or perhaps this could be the actual thing they do, caught up laughing at others knowledge and smarts that they see all so little to them, if this is the kind of person they are now, means they would flee somewhere logical for a spot to be unfound at, unless Alovo heads to it. Or perhaps they will pull the disguise stuff just like how that creepy Balaur guy did with them. So an answer is figured out if so, one that should help them before things get worse, before they all could be deep in this situation of some kind. “Alovo, if the countdown happens to go down, what happens?.” Brook then asked, which made everyone look at her for saying that, she may be crazy for what she has in mind right now, even Alovo seemed to stare at that, but he stared in a new way, an almost fearful way that says something bad about it would very well happen even to him. </p>

<p>Alovo seemed to not answer for a moment, just staring as if he wasn’t sure if to say, it was clear it’s danger, it really was, which yet can notice Mugman seemed to worry trying to go over to comfort Alovo but Sans stopped him whispering a “Don’t, who knows if this is some sort of trap.” which shows Sans wasn’t sure if to trust this even for a second, which left some worries around. Alovo only stared though seemed to see the offer, which only made him actually smile for a second but it went back to being stuck with this dull scared look that he then spoke up slowly now to answer the question from before. “That’s when the act falls like the lever..” for the way Alovo said it was different for how he was speaking the whole time before, making everyone grow worried because of it but also what was said as well. </p>

<p>“Hey.. It’s okay, look we will try to put a stop to this, we want to help stop all of this, like how we helped perhaps another you might know..” Brook said while going over carefully without fear to put a gentle hand on Alovos shoulder to try and comfort him a little but very carefully which Bendy wanted to try and move her away but didn’t yet for wasn’t sure what would happen. Alovo was silent to it, staring at her able to see how those eyes were studying her in a interesting way, it was like a mixture of checking her out but also trying to understand as well at the same time, which yet she can’t do much of for maybe he feels forced to do such a thing like that anyways. Till Alovo began to grin like how he was before feeling like this but yet this time had a more friendly feel to it the before but still was like it was the same as before as well, then he spoke up with a “You got a real fine body and personality Brookie Dookie~” </p>

<p>Upon hearing that Bendy quickly got Brook by her arm to pull her away now and behind him to protect her, but yet the message was clear in some way that Alovo found her really nice for wanting to help for all of this, though the nickname was weird but it’s better then being called ‘little gem’ so much from someone else. “NOW WHAT KIND OF NICKNAME IS THAT!?? SHE IS NOT FECES IF YOUR THINKING ON KEEPING THAT DOOKIE THERE!” Bendy yelled a bit at Alovo which Alovo only grinned just like the way he did before. “Mmmm~ How about I call her Mo-” then Alovo stopped seeming like he is hearing something again, the countdown, except this time he doesn’t seem that focused on handling it like he was before, as if what was said before was to remind him it will all be handled with and over soon, but does seem clear he has to handle it. “Mmmm~ I hear the clock ticking again!~ I will go on to handle it~ Don’t grow lonely without me now~” Alovo said seeming to get ready right away, then suddenly he looked to a direction moving his tail in a way to ready for something before running off quickly onward to that direction as if he can sense something that way they all could not, which Bendy tried to chase after but Alovo went far to ahead far to quickly, surely quite fast to think. “DAMMIT!” “Well great, we lost the key to getting answers to things” Sans added to what Bendy had said while Bendy came back over in annoyance. Surely a wonder what to do now, if Sonic was here to think he would’ve caught up with the guy for how fast he was, but still there hasn’t been any sign of him to be found sadly, he has to be somewhere, but maybe they could try to follow Alovo even despite all of them not being the fastest. </p>

<p>“Hmm, look we can’t just stand here I think, we should follow him even despite him being ahead, just got to figure out a way how.” “Brook, How can we?? That dude is fast as we clearly saw and it will take forever to-” During when Bendy was saying that about to go over he quickly stopped seeing a portal appear right from underneath where he was gonna step but he stumbled back quickly same with Brook, making them look at it in confusion. Looking in can see it seems as though it’s a portal that still connects to this universe for it still had the appearance but it looked further through the universe which can see some people running by within the portal, which yet is a wonder what the chances of that now to appear right before them, almost like magic to even think. “HOW DOES THIS STUFF KEEP HAPPENING HERE!?? Bendy shouted looking at it in confusion but more annoyed how he almost fell into one again. </p>

<p>“Hm, odd the chances of that, things have been getting real weird for luck since Brook showed to even think” Sans said going to the portal to study it which made Mugman come over as well to look. “Well! That must mean we are lucky to have her! We should go in then if this is her luck!” Mugman said, looking to the portal about to go down to see how it could work, feeling the ground there, seems although it’s in the ground this portal on the other side it must be against a tree so which would be quite difficult to try and go through if so but if they do so carefully then they should be alright. “Welp! I’m going first then!” Bendy said, then looked to the portal without fear of it and figured a way to step in before doing so and ended up on the other side just fine, looking to the rest for where the portal is and smiled. </p>

<p>He then offered his hand out to help bring the rest in, which the rest looked to one another, which Sans tested it next ignoring Bendys offer but gone through just fine, then Mugman went in next taking Bendys offer and was able to get through with Bendys help, then it was Brooks turn, taking Bendys offer that's still there, took a moment to breath, then stepped on in to go on through to the other side. </p>

<h5>Clever, Clever,  they all yet are</h5>
<h5>Especially those behind the scenes…</h5>
<h5>But who's to say one wouldn’t notice who they are?.</h5>

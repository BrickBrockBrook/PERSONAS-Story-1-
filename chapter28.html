<h2>Chapter 28. It’s going to be Alright</h2>

<p>The air was cold, musty and dead. Dead in a way that was more, welcoming for how it was, not a stressful or harsh feeling, but it felt natural strangely, like its a normal occurrence in this universe they yet wonder in, hearing the wooden floors creak at times they take a step or how the place echoed whenever each step was made or movement was taken rather it be their own or farther away elsewhere, it surely felt like they’re all wandering in a maze it feels, left guessing where they’ve been and where they're going, but of course who can guess where even exactly are they going judging by how this place keeps leaving more and more mysteries. “This is strange.. Why does Bendy come from a universe like this?? I thought it was more colorful and nice!” Mugman spoke up with a worried look as they walked alongside the rest which is a fair point to bring up, how could this be a place Bendy came from? As much as could say this isn’t the place there's still the fact that there's posters and cutouts around that say Bendys name and have Bendy on them, so it's really strange. “Maybe it looks scary but it isn't bad though!” Sonic spoke up giving some reassurance that maybe it's just deceiving but yet that felt even that couldn’t be the case of it just looking scary if everywhere felt like you got to be careful or something would hear. “Are you sure that's exactly the case Sonic? Judging by the environment and how it is, I feel if this was a good place they would’ve done something to make it more welcoming versus be kept feeling so, dead” Baldi spoke up putting in what he thought of it all which really leaves more questions on how on earth did Bendy even come from a place like this, surely so many questions but so little answers. </p>

<p>“Maybe he tries to view stuff in a positive light?” Mugman asked which left everyone else to think on which Brook decided to speak now after hearing them all pitch in ideas. “Well, since I've known him the longest out of us here, he must be at least trying to see stuff in a positive light. It's what he learned despite how dark stuff can be, surely says whoever taught him that really helped him.” Brook answered which yet left everyone curious now, since they never knew the fact someone else was here with him, which says this place should be not so dead then if so, there has to be maybe people around here then surely. That's when a crash was heard above them, then another crash, sounding like there was battling going on above them, surely one that seemed slightly intense for how it was, making the group quite curious to the sound, seeing Sonic quickly dash around first to go ahead to see if there's any way up before coming back and looking to the rest. “If we just go ahead we should be able to get up there! It was hard to see what was happening so whatever is going on we best should be ready!” Sonic explained which the rest agreed as quickly they began to go onwards having Sonic lead a bit of the way for how to get there, going onwards and then taking a turn to find some stairs that seem to go upwards. The group quickly went up, reaching a hall they quickly went down which as they entered it felt darkness started to consume around as they went in, a strange darkness, one that didn’t behave normally seeing settle movements within the darkness but those movements didn’t seem to belong to anyone, like waves of water with the patterns and movements it makes not belonging to anyone but standing out to be noticeable, which can hear how the group slowed down because of it so they won’t get lost within this strange darkness that yet surrounds them all. </p>

<p>It surely seemed consuming this darkness, one where you can hardly see, or you could but it only guides to where the walls or floor is seeing how this darkness latched onto the walls and floor in such a strange way, like a light shining through an area. Although this darkness started to feel off, really off, at least to Brook, like, something tells her to escape, which when trying to reach for the rest it felt she touched something almost wet, like running the hand down some thick waterfall, but it’s hard to tell what it was, but yet, whatever it was grabbed hold of her arm squeezing onto it in a painful way. Almost like whatever this is was a person, but not any of the rest for its intentions seem to be wanting to harm. But quickly can hear what seems like this thing was attacked judging by how it felt the feeling of their arm being grabbed and whatever that waterfall feeling was quickly slipped away out having let go as quickly felt like one the others got hold of her hand and quickly they began to run through this darkness, hearing a roar behind them as they ran onwards to escape whatever is in this consuming darkness that lurks around. Feeling how they all stumbled through the darkness but pushed onwards trying to escape whatever was within it, hearing it roar louder as it followed, it seemed to know where they are judging by how close it yet sounds that kept a darkness going onwards, they all kept trying to go through, hearing how Mugman kept saying to be careful while can hear Baldi trying to watch where he goes as he brought Brook along as can hear Sonic seeming to lead the way to get them all out somehow, but of course who knows where they’re going. There has to be a way through, there has to be. Till that's when suddenly came a feeling of being pulled by something else but looking it's hard to see what, it was like nothing was there. </p>

<p>But yet made Brook wind up pulling the rest that way to try and escape, seeming to then lead to them suddenly all fall down it feels, fading out of the darkness and crashing into some inky puddle once again that was below them saving them from their fall down, at least now they have yet escaped whatever was within that darkness but yet who knows where they are now, it almost feels they just keep going further down and deeper at this rate. “What was that thing back there?” Sonic spoke up, being the first to get out from this puddle pretty quickly, getting any extra of this blackened stuff off while helping the rest get out from it as well. Which the rest got some of the stuff off before Baldi seems to try his best to answer. “Who knows, whatever it was wasn’t friendly. Maybe it was another stronger COTS?” Baldi offered up that idea to leave everyone to think except Brook, since after all, she was the one who seemed to feel it in the darkness. “It felt like it was made out of the same stuff around here, I doubt it’s another COTS because of that being the case” Brook answered which yet left everyone to think on that, truly leaving a realization of something. This place is dangerous. The very place Bendy likely has come from, is dangerous, which yet, leaves a reminder that they all must continue to try and find them, just to try and find them somewhere around here in this vast maze, just leaves hopes they’d find them quickly. “Well! That was quick thinking from Brook though to get us away from what was there!” Mugman smiled looking at Brook who gave a smile back upon hearing that. </p>

<p>It is a fair point that at least with that quick thinking they were able to once again get out of a tough situation. That’s when they can hear ahead what sounds like people talking, which yet, the voices sounded a bit familiar, could it be? Suddenly quickly can see how Sonic was already dashing ahead to check, causing the rest to follow to come and check with, quickly taking turns before reaching this hole within the floor, looking in can see it was the rest! But yet they seemed to be chased by something that can see Bendy was leading the way as Sans and Jevil were throwing attacks behind them for whatever could be chasing them, which trying to look closer to see, it was that same large COTS with that strange scribbled eye, who paused at the hole to look in seeing its menacing eye try to look in but everyone else moved away quickly so it won’t see them. Feeling this presence that has been staring from the hole, only able to slightly see its eye checking around before seeing a hand reach out to feel what's around out there, causing the rest to move further back, it’s clearly trying to find them, but they can’t let it find them here so there has to be some way to get around it or at least, some way to stop it. Which as they stood back can suddenly see quickly from above crashing through the roof was what looked to be Jevil with his scythe seeing there shine stars around the scythe before once crashing into the COTS that was underneath can see a blast of a beam shoot out from the hole tearing up some the floor and roof it hit before vanishing this beam while everything was still now, no COTS reaching out, but where's Jevil? “Jevil?” Brook asked out, going over to the hole first which the rest tried to stop but couldn’t. Looking into the hole can see the COTS was gone but Jevil layed there looking tired out but seeing him slowly stand again and look up, still holding the very scythe he used to defeat it and he smiled all so tiredly, normally he's so full of energy but this time he's tired, but he looked through the tiredness he felt and the energy that took out from him, victorious in some way, Which yet leaded to him shouting. “TAKE THAT,THAT BEAST! YOU CANNOT KILL,KILL ANYBODY NOW!” Jevil smiled widely as he nearly fell to the ground after but saw some bones quickly catch him from falling, seeing Sans emerge from the hole above and drop down to the floor the rest were on and down again to where Jevil is while can see Bendy emerge from the above hole too landing on the floor the rest are on. “There you guys are!” Bendy spoke up once having landed down, smiling at them all seeing Mugman was the first to quickly run over happily. “You guys are okay!” Mugman cheered giving Bendy a hug which he wasn’t expecting but smiled anyway letting Mugman do so till Mugman let go checking the hole now to know what’s happening. “Where in inky hell have any of you been??” Bendy spoke up, going to the rest to check on them. </p>

<p>“We just winded up split ways somehow when we entered” Sonic spoke up while Baldi nodded in agreement to it along with Brook nodding to agree as well, which yet can tell Bendy seems to be trying to think on why that could’ve happened judging by the look he had seeming puzzled but in thought. Then can see Mugman was helping Sans and Jevil back up onto the floor everyone was on lending a helping hand to bring what looks like a tired Jevil that Sans was having to carry, seeming like that took a lot of energy out of him to do something like that since normally he's so full of energy, but this time around he isn’t, which caused Sonic to dash over as well to help hold Jevil up with Sans so it's not all too much for him. Then Bendy, Baldi and Brook went over to check as well for how Jevil was from it who noticed everyone come around to either try to help or know what's going on, after all they all are in this together, which Jevil only laughed upon seeing this before deciding to try and speak. “I HAVEN’T DONE A MOVE,MOVE LIKE THAT IN SO LONG,LONG!” Jevil laughed, exhausted but still keeping some energy to speak. Jevil then tried to stand up but quickly was stopped from Sans which led to Sonic following Sans's lead due to helping hold Jevil up, which Jevil wasn't phased by being stopped. “Just rest for now Jevil, should be safe here-” “No, no we're not safe staying in one place for too long guys! Otherwise anything out here can get us. Besides we're so close we just got to find where this thorn is taking us to escape this place!” Bendy interrupted Sans, holding up the thorn to show the rest the key to perhaps finding the portal or something to stopping the chaos, which intrigued the rest but yet it was strange why Bendy seems so urgent to get to following it judging his attitude. </p>

<p>“But, wouldn’t it be good to get some rest? We still have time and if we keep using up our energy we could be within risk of danger happening.” Baldi spoke up, leaving everyone to look to Bendy to see how he’d respond to this, it's a fair point but yet Bendy seems yet so still hesitant on that idea, surely a mystery why. “In this universe? We can’t stay in one place out here for too long, that’s how a lot of dangers can find you out here, trust me, I'd know. So yes I know it would be best to.. I fear that we can’t unfortunately in this case, but I promise as soon as we escape here we can rest! Think! We’re so close now! We can save so many and be home free!” Bendy went on to explain, he was making it clear why they got to keep going, which really gave a fair reasoning, he knows the place best, he knows what dangers lurk and surely some of them have seen quite a bit of the dangers hell there could be more for all they know out here, so might as well believe him with this, besides he's right, there so close now and soon when there done they all can perhaps go home. “LETS DO THIS!” Jevil suddenly shouted seeing him get his scythe out and ready, surprising he already has so much energy despite what they pulled off back there. When everyone as well got ready, they are nearing the end they have to be, soon everyone will be saved and they all get to head home safely, though, it feels almost, maybe this all doesn’t have to end, maybe if they all can somehow stay connected together… But, of course that is just an idea, for now, it’s time to save these universes. Quickly then Bendy began to step ahead to lead the way holding the thorn to study where its headed and everyone began to quickly follow along with, diving onwards into the darkness of a hallway up ahead, although consuming, can see slightly in the dark how Bendy leaded on, knowing there's a way through this darkness, no wonder why he isn’t worried of the dark, because he must be so familiar with it that it doesn’t ever happen to bother him in the slightest. The group went onwards, sticking close together letting Bendy lead them out for it seems he knew where to go through this darkness that seemed to only slowly somehow yet get darker, but can hear how it sounds the rest began to hold onto each other even got to feel some hold on to them too while can still figure Bendy was yet leading on despite it all, just this darkness, it kind of felt loud this time around, like it isn’t a normal darkness, like it felt alive, almost like before in one the universes it kind of felt like that too, but it just felt darker this time around. </p>

<p>Though, as much the darkness consumes, as much as it feels each step echos or how cluttered this darkness seems, knowing the rest are around, each holding onto each other as they work together to get through this darkness, it felt, reassuring, like there was light in the dark although not literally it felt like it, which makes everything feel it’s going to be okay and they all can get through this, they must be getting closer to stopping this madness, they must be. Soon the darkness faded as they stepped back into the lightsider side of this hallway having overcome that darkness over them all like the darkness was putting a weight onto their shoulders but it’s all let go. Which yet they each let go of each other and continued onwards, the group ready to face any danger that comes there way and there pace really has quickened as can tell they must be knowing the way now to there, but as they got further way from the dark it felt like- something was off, something was lurking in them, but it’s unknown what it is, like something is watching, waiting to strike but not just yet, or will it? Who truly knows. Everyone's guard remained up as they went through, taking quick turns and what seems like shortcuts Bendy knew around the place that got them further in for wherever they are, going through what felt like a strange maze that only one of them seems to know where there going and the rest are stuck following, hoping they’d reach the destination there working their way to. </p>

<p>As the darkness came back around as they dove downwards that this place seems to go, causing everyone to hold onto each other again as they went, the darkness consuming even feeling harder to see this time around but they won’t lose each other in this darkness luckily, as long as they all stay holding on they’ll get through it. Though it felt like a lot the darknesses they've been in, it felt they weren't alone, maybe it's rather a fear of feeling something is following you in the dark, maybe it's just a feeling or a play within the minds to thinking somethings there, so many possibilities but only one can determine the truth. That's when it felt like something else grabbed hold of Brooks hand, causing her to try and see what it was but it was too dark, it didn't fight or anything, in fact it walked with, just holding on, it didn't seem like any of the rests, in fact it felt rather large, or even rather small, it's hard to tell it's like it at times feels larger than it should or smaller than it should, but it was clear something had hold of her. But it didn't fight so, maybe it's okay? Or is that just a hope or being naive? But they walked on a long, the group sticking together while it feels none are aware what's following them in the dark. Which can notice slightly in the dark how Bendy paused or slowed down causing the group to stop, then felt he turned judging by how hand let go but held on again studying the darkness, leaving everybody confused. Till can sense how he was reaching out judging by how the hand pushed a bit and the sense of someone's breathing is near, till can tell he stopped once it seems he found something. Which once they have suddenly felt a harsh yank of being pulled along and hence what felt like a chase began, surrounded in the dark being chased by something that was in here, hearing it loudly roar a roar so distorted but loud as it hunted them down through this blackened maze this feels to all be. Seeing in the dark sparks of magic fly out from the rest rather of blues or purples or light blues just fighting back the creature that chased them in the dark, unknown what it is but something about it looked large for anything that was hit, this surely isn't good. They went on feeling pulled for each turn and what felt hops over objects that were around in the dark, until quickly when hitting into something caused what looks like a light prop to flash on shining bright and landing down at the path to where this creature must be, but when it shown it was gone but seen crawling back into the darkness. For seeing the hand that slithered in being of pure darkness just like it or perhaps it was made of some other substance to, who truly knew but it allowed for the group to slow down while they were rushing and take a moment to breathe, that was a close one there and truly a surprise they even got through that. “What was that?” Sans spoke up looking to Bendy which caused everyone else to do so as well. </p>

<p>“Yeah! There's still so much unanswered things around here could care for at least an idea what is even this place! Like- Stuff popping into your face! Weird liquid around, this weird demon looking thing in the darkness, then this???” Sonic went on a rant trying to get answers to but can tell Bendys serious expression changed when he heard demon in the dark to a more concerned one. “A demon..” “YEAH! Though you guys weren't with us during then but there was this whole-” suddenly quickly Bendy covered Sonics mouth with his hand and studied around in a rush, making everyone keep quiet now as he did so, this is quite worrisome now seeing how worried Bendy seems to be getting before calming down and deciding some explaining is needed. “Okay.. So.. There's some things I haven't told you about this.. Place..” Bendy spoke up calmly but with a lowered tone, making everyone listen in closely. “This place is… like hell. There's these- people- affected and changed who’d try to attack you, trick you, kill you. All under the obey of the demon that walks this place, who isn’t friendly I tell you. Just several souls, trapped in the ink. Only some are.. Born without. ..Like me..” Bendy spoke weakly in some way once they said the last part, their expression although it had a little smile to reassure it is okay, something about it hurt, it’s no wonder why he was so excited to be anywhere but here, something about this place… Seems to hurt him and who is to blame him? “.. Then let's get out of this place fast if it's dangerous. Can't let these slow us down from our goal” </p>

<p>Brook spoke up going over to where Bendy is to show she was on their side with this, which when she turned to the rest can see how they all seemed to come over ready as well to show they're ready to all go and agree with this, if this place is dangerous it's best to move quick, no matter what they face against or what tries to slow them down. Bendy then had a real smile on there face feeling motivated once hearing that, quickly turning around making sure the thorn was still in hand and began to lead the way once again, causing the rest to be quick to follow with through the darkness that although could’ve felt a consuming dark it felt bright, like a strong light marched on through it with them guiding them all the way onwards, although they can’t see, it’s almost like they all know the way, all being ready to fight when the time comes around for if any danger decides to show up at all during this. Soon the group ran out to an area with a lot more light feeling it beam down on them after having been in the darkness for so long able to see more clearer the confidence everyone has dashing onwards Bendy leading the way and taking quick turns at any corners that everyone managed to copy in turning in such quick ways, they got to hurry to get there, which once going to turn in one the halls Bendy stopped them all causing everyone else to stop along with, which was confusing why they stopped them, till they looked into the hall. The hall seems to be covered with portals all around, from each wall to the roof and scattered along the floor, seeing some portals even collide with each other causing it to deform and create a bigger portal to who knows where now, but surely all of it leaves quite the intimidating sight, shows that everywhere is only getting worse with the portal thing. Though yet, it seems they got to find their way through it due to how the thorn was behaving, so they began to look to each other for ideas which luckily seems Sans thought up an idea quickly to get across, summoning one of his blasters as he then got onto it, looking to the rest now to clue in to hop aboard. Jevil was the first zooming towards it and already hoping on causing the blaster to spin around a bit but regained its balance with Sans’s help which when Sans looked to Jevil with a slightly annoyed look Jevil just laughed seeing it. Then now the rest wind up getting on board carefully managing to get each one of them just one it as Sans began to control the blaster to go onwards, managing to stay right in the middle dodging each the portals around as they slowly hovered across keeping steady as they went through, everyone keeping close to ensure they won't risk falling into any of these portals around them. Soon they reached the end the hall which as it was believed that should be it, turning the corner they only see more portals, like its only getting worse overtime truly this place, so they continued onward all staying huddled on this blaster that leaded on, which yet allows well, perhaps more questions to be answered perhaps as they went on. </p>

<p>“So.. Who here-” “I GOT ONE BETTER,BETTER! HOW ARE YOU BENDY SO,SO CHEERY DESPITE GROWING HERE,HERE??” Jevil interrupted Brook quickly, seeing how he spun around on the blaster to look to Bendy while nearly hitting into a portal in the process but yet dodged it in time. “Wh- Okay straight to that. Well, it’s because as soon as I- well, came to be, I met someone who- showed me the way, put a light into the dark situation I was in. Someone who was brave, clever, a bit naive but- they were like family to me. But, they didn’t belong to this universe and eventually left. But they put a hope in things, a light to the situation, an idea of- perhaps a way out from here. A light in the darkness that once you reach it, it’s all gonna be okay.” Bendy smiled once he said that last little bit, which made Brook look over finding that familiar really, a light outside the dark, something you can find once you make it through, it truly isn’t wrong. “You sure got a way of viewing things” Sans mumbled but yet it still caught everyone's attention since there isn’t much sound going on around so it surely felt loud in some sense, which yet got Jevil right away to question him. “WELL ISN’T IT FAIR,FAIR TO SEE THINGS THAT WAY?? I MEAN, TO DARE SAY, SAY DON’T YOUUUU SEE STUFF THAT WAY?” Jevil asked quickly which Sans was silent upon hearing that question, one that surely must’ve left him with some thoughts upon it. “You know you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to Sans!” Mugman spoke up more so like they are standing up for him in some way which did leave it clear that he doesn’t have to answer now, which Jevil seemed annoyed at that for the chance he won’t answer but, was accepting of it in some way anyway for if he doesn’t have his question answered. </p>

<p>“I try to. Is that good enough for an answer for you? Shouldn’t I be asking that question right back in fact?” Sans answered then asked leaving Jevil to not expect some form of an answer and at that the same question right back, but he didn’t seem intimidated at the very least. “PFFT! I OF COURSE,COURSE DO! TIS A WAY TO SEE FREEDOM,FREEDOM!” Jevil answered leaving everyone a little lost what he exactly meant by it but he did at least answer. “So is this a question we’re just passing around now?” Baldi asked which yet brought Mugman and Sonic's attention quickly since they seem to already have answers. “Absolutely do!” Both Mugman and Sonic said at the same time which made them look at each other and smiled at that. “Well, guess we all think on the lighter side of things.” Baldi answered, causing everyone to smile, guess they all really do then to look at the light side of things. Huh, light side, it almost feels like its- natural perhaps to say about them all? The light side of things that go wrong. The light during the chaos. The light side. Which then suddenly when paying attention again that's when Brook can hear a question being asked. “Is that the portal to the universe?”</p>

<h5>Don’t you ever get tired of your progress?</h5>
<h5>Do you ever feel you’re getting nowhere?</h5>
<h5>Though yet, you march onward despite the weight</h5>
<h5>An unstoppable force, for a chance of destiny. </h5>

<h2>Chapter 27. Lost in the depths</h2>
 

<hr class="new3">

<p>“Look at what you’ve done!” A voice shouted, causing the little kid to look over to see a smiling face laughing away as they cleaned up the flour they spilt all over the kitchen floor. “SORRY!” The little kid spoke up which made the smiling figure smile more. “Oh don’t worry dear! We all spill something everywhere! You’re father used to all the time after all!” The smiling figure spoke as they cleaned the rest, getting it all cleaned up in some swift motions before tossing the rest the flour as they got back to work seeming to bake some kind of dessert with the help of the little kid who brought the flour back over more carefully for them to scoop some out from the bag and add it in. “So, as I was saying, Although it's getting to the time we should be moving it’s for the better good my little jester!” “B-BUT! WE’D BE AWAY FROM FAMILY!” The little kid spoke up as the figure explained mixing the ingredients while they checked the recipe for the next step in the process. “Well, dear it’s.. A little complicated for you to understand right now but some tough stuff is going on between the family, but! Don’t worry! We can move away then come right back once everything has settled! It will be just you and I-” “AND DAD?” The kid added that the figure looked to the kid with a smile but it was more worried appearing like one that reasons it's there the little kid was clueless of. </p>

<p>“Yes sweetie.. And dad.” the figure responded making the little kid not like hearing how they sounded there or looked, it just didn’t feel right. “MOM?.. WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH DAD COMING TOO?” the little kid asked, making the mom pause what they were doing and take a moment to breathe before they looked at their little kid now. “I think we need some vanilla for these cookies, could you get me some dear?” the figure asked, which the little kid turned around to go ahead and find some before hearing the front door open followed with laughter that felt unsettling, maniac if you will, dads home. </p>

<hr class="new3">

<p>Jumping over puddles, dashing along the wooden boards and swinging his scythe like a maniac to try and strike down Clubtacka who kept on dashing ahead seeming quite beat up but so is this scythe wielder, roughened up but eyes that glared at Clubtacka which they readied there scythe before being knocked right back down by Clubtacka who ran back onwards quickly seeming to jump up through these wooden boards on the ceiling and climb their way up to somewhere unknown leaving the scythe wielder to lay there exhausted but as they tried to give chase there was this blacked stuff making them stick a bit to the ground, making them quickly slash at it with their scythe to get back up. “ARGHH! I ALMOST GOT YOU,YOU!” They screamed, readying to dash and climb up before feeling something grab his tail to stop him. “Jevil, let her run. She wouldn’t get far out here” looking over can see it was Bendy, who seemed to be a little exhausted but seems to have found Jevil out here, who slowly went down but looked to Bendy confused now as he checked around to see if the rest was with him but there was nobody in sight. “WH- WHERES THE REST,REST??” Jevil readied their scythe scanning around for any clues that could be around. “They’re further back searching as well and well- getting familiar with where we are now.” Bendy answered before seeming to then look around himself seeing how his expression shifted into concern as he looked around, which was strange and yet gave Jevil a chance to look around though realizing his outfit has yet changed here, now wearing a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up and these slick pants to go with the shoes as they now had this hat that was more like an older styled cap of some kind, which yet even seems because of this appearance his scythe as well looks more to match his appearance for how he looks being less colorful and more like a normal scythe, but the key thing is there was a lack of color, everything here looked like some kind of coloration of gold or orange so it's unknown what the colors really are for these things all because its drained it of any to these blacks or these yellows of some kind. Jevil looked at Bendy. It's odd how Bendy still yet looks the same here, nothing different at all, but why is that? Unless, this answers his concerned expression. “ARE YOU FROM,FROM HERE??” Jevil asked Bendy who looked over giving a small smile but his expression only looked slightly more concerned. “I think it’s kind of obvious… Let's just- focus on what needs to get done quickly, Come on.” Bendy then turned around leading the way as Jevil quickly then began to follow, having their scythe at the ready whenever even though the area seems to have quite the lack of portals, almost like its a luck any can open around here strangely but the fact Bendy still is allowing Jevil to despite how there is no dangers currently, makes it feel like there is dangers he knows that is here he isn’t saying about, but for now, Jevils just left to guessing and following for the time being until then. </p>

<hr class="new2">

<p>The ground felt cold, it felt dark, the air even felt damp but a very thick dampness that throws your senses off, while it felt like suddenly one was sinking, slowly but surely, leading to one to quickly open their eyes to find there sinking into this blackened stuff on the ground acting as some form of a liquid trying to pull them down which quickly they broke free from it dragging themselves out by holding the boards along the walls as a guide to pull themselves out and onto the wooden boards of the ground that is outside this blacked puddle. Which looking down can realize one was wearing a change of clothes here, being in some form of older fashioned jacket and a skirt along with it while wearing these mini boots that got a slight heel to them which although there are some stains probably from being within that blackened stuff, it's strange how their outfit even changed, but, it's happened before back at that one universe where they met Mugman and all. Wait, speaking of where is the rest anyway? They all jumped in together. How did they all split up in some way? Strange. Maybe they can find them around here somewhere, they shouldn’t be far after all, so they quickly ringed out any stuff that got in their hair and began to go onwards to try and find the rest now. The boards creaked under them, but it's fine, although the place echoed and sent chills around almost feeling like some eerie presence watching closely, there not letting it get to them, just got to focus on the goal at hand since after all universes are still opening everywhere so surely there bound to maybe even come across some while out here, they got to come across something out here. </p>

<p>Till can hear noise from ahead sounding like muffled voices of the rest, they have to be up ahead, so quickly they began to hurry onwards to see if they can get to them, following wherever the muffled noises can yet be heard sounding like there getting closer but the muffled remaining strangely which leads to a worry something is going wrong and they need help if so then, causing them to pick up the pace managing to grab a piece of a wooden board while going by to use as a way to help in any way and soon once got to this door, opening the door.. Resulted in looking face to face with what looks like a COTS but isn’t there more covered in that stuff that's puddles around on the ground, which they quickly turned to look at them before quickly charging at them making them step back and slam the door closed using the board to block it off the best they can so they won’t come breaking in. “That… was close, come on Brook, they can’t be far here..” They told themselves, making Brook step away from the door and check around the area for any other places to go, there has to be somewhere the rest is at but. </p>

<h5>Above. </h5>

<p>That voice again, trying to guide her once again, while looking up studying the roof, there was one opening up and out going somewhere, just gotta get up there simply. She studied the area for anything that works to help be a way up, just standing nearby where the opening is, which she noticed some barrels around and brought those over to work as a way to help get up there but she couldn’t reach, she tried to jump which she kept getting closer and closer but missing each time until one the times she jumped and got hold, not of the ledge, but a hand got hold of hers. “You needed a lift??” a familiar voice spoke, making Brook look to see Sonic which he too had a change in outfit seeing he wore a bowtie and a vest of sorts with pants that look quite stained from being around here. Brook took hold of his hand more with a smile as Sonic pulled Brook up to another level that is around here, which Brook looked around once up not seeing any sign of the rest still making her look at Sonic again. “Any clue where the rest is?” Brook asked which Sonic gave a slight shrug with a look of slight worry. “I mean I think I heard Jevil and Bendy somewhere but I couldn’t find them, each way I went was flooded with this blackened goop stuff which kept slowing me down! Even the fact any doors wouldn’t open when there was some was like this stuff kept it closed too. But! It did lead to us finding each other so hey! It’s a start to finding the rest!” Sonic explained before then bringing a positive light to things which Brook smiled and checked around the place to figure which direction to go. “Well, do you remember where you saw them? Maybe we can check around that spot for any other openings?” Brook asked which Sonic smiled at the thought and quickly began to lead the way which Brook followed the best she could, leaving hopes that the rest had to be somewhere. </p>

<p>They kept turning a few corners making it feel you can very much get lost here as they did before turning to one where he was zooming about to check around finding this little hole he must’ve looked through before to see them, but yet no clues elsewhere for a way to get there, which Brook studied around, which once she turned there was what looked like blackened eyes staring back ominously, making Brook stumble back making Sonic notice to quickly help Brook from nearly falling as they both look to see this cutout it seems, but not just some cutout with blackened eyes that stare on, no this, looks very much like Bendy, in fact perhaps it very well is, but how? That doesn’t make sense for there to be any cutouts of him, unless… “Is.. this Bendys home universe?” “Well if i had to guess from the cutout standing in front of us and the stuff around he looks made up of, yes?” Sonic answered unsurely but still quite sure to Brooks' question as both stared on at the cutout trying to figure out how it even got there anyway. Which Brook stepped around it to see if there was anything behind it seeing there was something drawn on the back being an arrow pointed upwards, making Brook look up to see this blackened puddle above them, which made Sonic go over to look as well, managing to jump up to see if he can touch it seeing when he did it quickly moved to a different spot farther from them, looks like they got to follow it. </p>

<p>Which quickly Sonic saw this as a sign to give chase, beginning to quickly go after it which Brook followed as the puddle on the ceiling kept zooming ahead each time Sonic could ever tap it before they got leaded to this corner where it showed to be some opening on the ceiling that it escaped to and through the cracks and all escaping them completely, which Sonic quickly jumped up and offered his hand to bring Brook up as well to wherever this next level yet takes them hopefully closer to wherever the rest are. They then went around, searching for any clues of sorts for the rest, walking onwards dodging any holes in the floor that seemed to be on this level, until Brook stopped at one as Sonic was going ahead but stopped once noticed Brook has stopped, causing him to look as Brook looked down into the hole and saw two of the rest, seeming to be discussing something, It looks to be Baldi and Mugman who too had a change in outfits. Mugman seemed to be in a dress shirt now while wearing some suspenders and pants along with it, as Baldi looked to be wearing a dress shirt as well but had a tie on and some pants that matched along with the dress shirt it looked like. Seeing the two were looking this direction seeming to hear something, seeing Baldi stand in front of Mugman for wherever it was slowly as Mugman readies an attack it seems, but it was confusing at first, till they heard a loud thud from there, seeing slowly emerge a COTS looking to have almost some form of an eye but it was all like someone took a white marker and scribbled it there, but it really was an eye. It then looked at them readying what looks to be a heavy fist to throw at them but can see Sonic quickly dashed in to get them both out and back into the hole above hearing the swing crash into a wall as Baldi and Mugman were startled by the sudden rescue as they were ready to fight or embrace for the worse but, the rescue changed that. </p>

<p>Once they realized it was Sonic and Brook who got them out, Mugman smiled before going over to the two happily. “Guys! Oh thank you so much, you saved us there! We would’ve been toast if it weren’t for you..” Mugman smiled as Sonic chuckled, seeing Mugman all thankful and cheery while Brook went to check on Baldi who was observing back down the hole checking if the COTS could hear them at all. It did. Suddenly another loud roar was heard seeing a heavy fist break the hole open some more making the rest dodge it fast, seeing its eye peeking in through the larger hole it made trying to get to the group, quickly Sonic got him and Mugman to the side Balid and Brook were on and began to lead the way fast out of there which everyone began to follow hearing this COTS begin to give chase going from each hole and swinging at it trying to knock them down but the group kept going onwards, Baldi having to quickly pick up Mugman to help them dodge while Sonic helped Brook out dodge some the holes in case they couldn’t keep up as much, which during it Mugman tried to shoot at the COTS to try and send it further back but that wasn’t working all so well, there has to be another way through this, before it gets a good swing on them, but it’s hard to think seeing that strange eye peak through the holes, something about it felt, stressful, unnerving something… </p>

<h5>To your left.</h5>

<p>Brook quickly caught focus once again and looked to the left seeing an opening and quickly turned into it signaling the others to follow who did quickly running into this hallway that went out and suddenly was met with a tunnel that looked to go down, this strange large pipe it seemed to dive on down from how high up they were, Might as well for it sounds the COTS was only tearing through the floors to make room for them to get up. Quickly Brook jumped down to go diving down into the tube which Sonic quickly shouted to Brook not but she already did causing him to follow suit, which Baldi and Mugman looked down and to each other before then quickly both jumped on down to diving down into what felt faded into darkness as they did so. It felt like endless darkness as they dived down, unable to see where the rest were and the light from above faded as the sounds of that COTS thrashing abouts faded away the deeper they dove down, it wasn’t until suddenly it felt they crashed down into what felt like a liquid not like water for how thick it felt but not too thick to hurt or leave them trapped, almost as thick like stew or a thicker gravy of some kind, which yet Brook felt a hand grab hold of hers within the darkness they crashed into and pulled her out to where light consumed the area once again seeing Baldi had helped pull Brook out from there as Mugman seemed to help Sonic out from it too, they got out of that, surely a surprise they did but they did. “Well, looks like we got out of that!” Sonic said quickly, shaking off any extra blackened stuff on him as he looked to the rest after having done so. “How did you even know that was a way to go?” Baldi asked Brook which is a fair question. But how is Brook to really say she just followed the voice that went through her head? Would it be confusing perhaps? “I just… when i saw it all i figured it's worth a try, it’s not a bad idea to take some chances on things after all..” Brook answered, which Baldi seemed to be thinking for a moment on what was said but yet Mugman and Sonic were quick to say what was said. “Yeah! It’s good to take some chances!” “That just means your heart guided us the way!” Sonic added on to what Mugman had said both smiling at Brook once that was answered, which leaves Baldi to just sigh and agree with this with a little smile.  “Well, let's get back to focus. How did any of us get split up here anyway? We all entered the portal around the same time” Baldi spoke up, leaving everyone else to start thinking now. “I’m not sure! I mean, I remember when going through I just winded up by myself somehow, maybe it has to be the portals doing to spew us out into different spots?” Sonic answered the best he can with a guess on why it did but yet who can be sure on how that's happened? Guess for now it's just being left to keep guessing. </p>

<p>“Maybe we can search and figure? I mean, it could help us think of some possibilities!” Mugman brought up an idea which can work, so everyone got ready as Brook decided to lead the way again since she did get them all down into wherever this is to then begin searching, hopefully they will find them all somewhere out here, they have to. </p>

<hr class="new2">

<p>Jevil and Bendy walked on Jevil breaking anything that looked breakable or got in the way laughing away as they did as Bendy was only quietly watching and continued to lead the way onwards through this place full of twists and turns, which Jevil seemed to see something ahead and run up to it going up to this statue that looked like Bendy and then looked to Bendy upon seeing it. “UEE HEE HEE! LOOKIE THIS,THIS! IT'S YOU,YOU!” Jevil poked at it with his scythe laughing away but Bendy wasn’t phased, in fact he didn’t even smile or laugh, he just looked and turned to a different pathway to continue to lead the way in search of the rest, which confused Jevil. “NOW WHAT,WHAT IN CHAOS,CHAOS KINGDOM HAS GOTTEN INTO,INTO YOU?” Jevil asked, following alongside Bendy now resting the scythe he had on his shoulder as they went onward, which Bendy looked on seeming to think on how to answer it. “Right now is not a good joking time Jevil, The rest are out here somewhere in this world that's…” Bendy didn’t finish what he was saying and just continued onward. “THAT'S WHAT? THAT'S WHAT BENDY?” Jevil asked but Bendy refused to answer and kept going forward, which Jevil wasn’t pleased with seeing him do so he spoke up louder. “THATS WHAT,WHAT BEND-” “DANGEROUS! IT'S DANGEROUS!” Bendy shouted after Jevil had shouted which made Jevil quiet down seeing Bendy seemed obviously stressed about this, which he took a moment to breathe, collecting himself before speaking again. </p>

<p>“Sorry I… I’m just a little tense right now being here. I just… didn’t expect somehow we’d all be back here in this place full of people that are crazy.” Bendy spoke with a calm tone to Jevil before looking away and going onward again which Jevil followed after hearing it, trying to think of some way to cheer up the mood after having learned that. After all there has to be some kind of way even in this dark scary place. That’s when soon a crash was heard from somewhere, causing Jevil and Bendy to look over, it sounded it was above but further down a hallway, which it was silenced followed after the crash before suddenly seeing something break through the floors being this club, Clubtacka is back. Tearing through the ceiling and down to where they are beat up from who knows what here but there club at the ready, and as they tried to get a closer look Clubtacka charged at them ready to sing but bones shot out from the ground quickly blocking Clubtacka from going onward seeing Sans step out from the whole appearing to be wearing a more so a pinstriped suit but the sleeves still yet had a torn near the shoulders, seeing he too looked beat up though and tired out, perhaps the whole time he’s been going after Clubtacka to stop them. Which quickly Clubtacka turned charging to them but Jevil jumped over the bones and knocked Clubtacka back away from Sans as Bendy took out one the bones from the ground to also knock Clubtacka further back and keep them back. “OH LOOKIE, LOOKIE THIS! HAHAHAHA! YOU KEPT, KEPT THEM RUNNING!” Jevil exclaimed going to Sans laughing while having their scythe ready looking to Clubtacka as Sans was taking a moment to breathe before answering. “You can say so.” Sans responded sounding breathless for how he was, but he managed to get some energy back somehow looking to where Clubtacka is now and getting ready as Bendy stood where Clubtacka is who's regaining there ground quickly charging at Bendy to swing but Bendy countered it with the one he still had in hand to block it before quickly sinking down and back up to ridge another and swing at them from behind into a wall before he then looked to the blackened puddles he has hit Clubtacka in and then whistled. </p>

<p>Seeing then creatures of sorts came out from the blackened stuff to drag Clubtacka down into it but Clubtacka quickly fought each one off knocking Bendy back but yet allowed Jevil and Sans quickly hit Clubtacka back in so they stay sinking or at least trapped within it which luckily did work. Clubtacka angrily shouted an annoyed yell of sorts while trying to escape this blackened stuff while the three watched figuring a plan on what to do now. “WHAT IS THIS SHIT!? LET ME OUT!” Clubtacka screamed looking at Bendy who got them in that stuff anyway, which Bendy wasn’t phased by Clubtackas yelling really. “Ink. Now, You better quit fighting with us and if it would be so kind you take us to the universe you’re from- ""NO! NEVER!” Clubtacka shouted which Bendy wasn’t phased by still despite it all, looking to Jevil and Sans seeing they both had mixed reactions hearing this. “Shouldn’t we find the rest first? Not like she's going anywhere anyway.” Sans decided to speak up, to which Bendy seemed to have an answer for this. “Yeah, but at least one of us could hold the portal open if so until then.” Bendy responded while stepping away from Clubtacka who still tried to break free from the ink but saw these inky hands keep pulling them back each time into this thickened substance that they constantly had to fight off. “OHHHH! CAN I HURT,HURT THEM WHILE THERE TRAPPED, TRAPPED??” Jevil quickly readied his scythe in excitement thinking they will but Sans lowered it down to give an obvious no which Jevil was disappointed by.</p>

 <p>“AWWW COME ONNN!” “Jevil that would risk them fleeing away into some portal that leads us back to square one” Sans explained to Jevils disappointment which Jevil tried to understand which at least didn’t get him to try attacking because of that being the case. “Look Clubtacka, it would be suggested you give us some way there, otherwise at this rate you’d be dragged down with the rest who were trapped in this.” Bendy answered getting concerned looks from Sans and Jevil upon hearing that, which Bendy looked back and was confused by their concerned looks. “What? It’s how stuff goes in this universe!” Bendy answered Sans and Jevils concerned looks which only made them more concerned learning that's the case, well, more so Sans grew more concerned while Jevil just laughed at learning that's how it goes around here. That’s when can hear angry yells of Clubtacka seeming to manage to pull themselves out as Bendy goes to hit Clubtacka back in they swung at Bendy before he could knocking them far away, as Sans goes to help Bendy up Jevil quickly got his scythe to swing at Clubtacka to knock them back down but Clubtacka dodged each swing before swinging harshly at Jevil to knock em back as they reach into the mask they still wore pressing a button in it judging by the sound that was made opening a portal behind themselves as they’ve pressed it. “YOU WON’T WIN! NEVER!” Clubtacka shouted while entering the portal which Jevil quickly tried to pull them back but Clubtacka swung at them hitting them off, making Bendy get up quickly having Sans follow seeing Bendy reach to the portal as Clubtacka entered managing to get their hand in to hold it open, which once did they looked to Sans and Jevil smiling that they got it this time which Sans and Jevil smiled back. But thats when can see a vine shoot out from it that had was a vine coloration but it had dark red thorns all along it, that then wrapped itself around Bendy's arm to throw him aside, which yet the vine retracted into the portal, seeing Jevil dash to grab it while Sans helped Bendy back up but it closed to quickly leaving them all back to square one. “SHIT!” Bendy yelled causing Sans and Jevil to look to Bendy who walked over to where the portal was trying to see or figure if it could come back somehow but of course nothing happened, which judging his look he does not seem so happy with this knowledge, in fact he looked stressed. “Well great! We’re back to hoping to the lord of this HELL here that another portal opens up somewhere that we are BEGGING is the correct one but this place is a MAZE!” Bendy spoke out with a tone that showed he was annoyed and upset. </p>

<p>Which when he raised his arms when saying maze he had to quickly lower an arm for the pain in it seeing that vine had stabbed into him with its thorns and managed to pick out one the thorns that was in it studying it for a moment seeing it rest in his hand, but then it wiggled a little in it, like it was trying to go some direction of sorts, but why and where? Unless, it's the one clue, the one hint how to get there, perhaps, that attack just spilled out where they all could be hiding. “Well, guess there's one thing that will take us there. So, another journey awaits, let's find the rest and follow where it’s going.” Sans spoke, causing Bendy to look over, then back to the thorn that rested in his hand and was able to smile this time around. They got the key to saving the world, so it's time to save it. </p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Another Start</h2>

<h5>Wake up…</h5>
<h5>Hey, Wake up…</h5>
<h5>Wake up.</h5>

<p>“Are you going to wake up? I Can tell you’re still fucking breathing so if you’re pretending your dead I’m not falling for that shit.” A voice familiar but not too much spoken up, which made Brook wake up to a bright, almost a slightly drawn appearance the area seems to have. Seeing then someone nearby just standing nearby able to see the red eyes from this person staring right at her almost like knives just trying to stab right through, which made her realize who it was now. “Wh-... Who…” Brook mumbled kind of, although really she knew who it was, it was that Stiex guy, he has the hood and all for what she remembers, but what was noticeable more about him was his face seeing odd lines from his eyes on it and looks mostly black and white aside from those glowing red eyes. What is odd though is how she winded up away from the rest and he’s here even talking to her. “You’re not dead. Alright. Now I got shit to do, next time don’t take fucking portals that lead to higher up places. You're a dumbass for it.” Can watch Stiex explain, staring at her as he turned around and began to walk away just leaving her here, which Brook quickly got up to try and follow but right when she stood and checked where he was, he was gone, but he must’ve gone ahead somewhere in this place perhaps, meaning it’s a good sign. She quickly got up and did realize she was back to normal for her appearance then how the previous universe made her look, which felt quite relieving to see even to see the necklace with that gem is still here, but she knows she is elsewhere, she just needs to find the rest. </p>

<p>“BROOK! YOU OUT HERE!??” Can hear a familiar voice shouting, sounds like the rest are safely here too, or so hopefully, making her quickly go over to where she heard it. “I’M OVER HERE!” Brook shouted as she went to where she heard it, hearing footsteps come to her as she went towards the sound as well. Once She saw it was Bendy it just felt more like a relief to see someone familiar around here. “Oh thank the inky lord you’re okay! God didn’t suspect one of those flying COTS to come chasing us in here knocking so many of us away..” Bendy spoke with relief in his tone as he went to where Brook is just able to take a second to settle down though it seems he isn’t entirely, perhaps he doesn’t know where the other two are just like how she doesn’t know. “I hardly remember that… But it’s okay I’m sure we all survived it in some ways ""Real question is- HOW THE HELL DID YOU SURVIVE A FALL LIKE THAT??? THERE ISN’T SNOW HERE TO HELP THE FALL THERE WASN’T ANYTHING HELPFUL TO CATCH YOURSELF IN THERE ISN’T WATER OUT THIS WAY AND YOU DON’T HAVE POWERS FOR WHAT WE ALL KNOW TO HELP SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???” Bendy shouted, Clearly he wasn’t trying to be harsh in any way he was just worried and concerned while confused at the same time. </p>

<p>“I don’t remember… But what I know is when I woke up that Stiex guy was here, meaning there must be people here to help us find who's causing this chaos.” Brook explained as she looked to where she remembers seeing Stiex but of course nobody is there, it’s confusing why he was there and if he was the one who did and why, there’s too much unknown on the guy anyways. “WHAT!?? OKAY WELL CLEARLY THAT’S A SIGN! WE GOT LUCKY WITH THIS HERE BUT WHAT- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT??? Okay this is confusing but- OKAY! Let’s find the rest first though! I remember seeing them go in a direction closer to the water around here so maybe they landed in it sooo- ONWARD!” Bendy almost shouted the last bit, as he turned around and began to lead the way since he remembers where it was as Brook began to follow with, hopefully they can find the rest, but really it is good all the questions for Bendy to ask, why did he, it’s so confusing this guy that has been showing up at times even talking to some people about something, maybe if they could if there is a chance, can try to encounter the guy themselves. But the two went on, seeing this world be quite colorful despite the almost drawn look going on that somehow Bendy paid no mind to during it, but Brook was mostly because she isn’t used to it and it’s odd, how come Bendy isn’t paying much mind to it? Perhaps for wherever he came from it’s similar like this too. Soon it seems they managed to get to a more open space away from the trees and be able to see some simple little houses around and pathways  all having their own space and even can see through the trees ahead just some water, which Bendy quickly began to hurry over to which surprised Brook causing her to follow. “MUGMAN! SANS! YOU OUT HERE?” Bendy shouted out in hopes for a response but nobody responded back, making Bendy kind of run now while Brook kept up with him. Bendy kept running on till soon both Brook and Bendy reached the water, which Bendy stood near trying to search around the area for if they were here while Brook did the same while taking a quiet breather from all the running. </p>

<p>“MUGMAN! SANS! WHERE ARE YOU?” Bendy shouted while searching quickly, can tell he was getting quite worried which Brook is getting worried too, did something happen to them? Where are they? They have to be somewhere. But Bendy and Brook paused once they heard a distant shouting of “OVER HERE!” Somewhere, while Bendy and Brook tried to figure out exactly where, Brook managed to figure out though before Bendy on where, it’s just further out into the water, which she then looked to Bendy now. “Do… You know how to swim?” Brook quietly spoke up, which Bendy looked to her once she said that then to the water. “Don’t you?” “I… Never fully learned…” Brook mumbled a bit in embarrassment, which Bendy looked at her just not judging her for any of this for what one can see for the expression on his face. “Well! Don’t worry! Just wait right here then! I will go out there and find them!” Bendy spoke up with a smile, able to tell he had zero judgment for it as he got ready and quickly went right into the water and began to swim to where he heard it. Brook waited where she was watching him do so as she just had to wait now. </p>

<h5>Jump…</h5>

<p>A not so friendly voice just echoed through her head, just scaring her for a moment where she nearly fell in but kept to where she was, just focusing on watching for the rest, which by the looks of it can see it seems like some people coming over from the water now, that must be them. Which Brook tried to get closer to see but, just in seconds she didn’t have time but fell right into the water, which was unsuspectingly deep for how much she crashed in, trying to grab the ledge or anywhere by it to pull herself up but it was either to far or just not possible to get a grip on. She began to panic quietly but before she could really fully do so just felt something grab her hood and pull her right out fast hearing multiple splashes right after. “You should be more careful next time.” Can hear a familiar voice saying which looking to see it was Sans which seems he was the one who pulled out from the water while can see Bendy and Mugman to the side just trying to dry off it seems. “Thanks…” “Your welcome, just next time swim instead of climb.” Sans replied to Brook which sure is easy to say but not easy to do for her at least. “Oh woah! You guys really do look different from how you looked in the other universe!” Mugman exclaimed as he looked around the area then to the rest. “Well you do too! Not drowned in some oversized cloak!” Bendy replied while studying Mugman better which is true for Mugman was now wearing just a black long sleeve, blue shorts that matched with his straw and nose and some brown shoes, nothing quite like what he wore before in the other universe, guess it must’ve changed everyones appearance in the other universe aside from the COTS and perhaps whatever Uvilein did there to possibly look back to normal. “Well, Anyone recognize this universe?” Sans decided to speak up as he looked around which caused the rest to do the same thing as well. While everyone was trying to figure what this place could be, Mugman seemed to have quite the reaction to it all, then he shouted suddenly once it seemed he realized something. “It’s- IT’S MY UNIVERSE! THAT MEANS MY BROTHERS AND GRANDPA IS HERE!” Mugman then began to quickly dash in a certain direction now as if he remembers the way now, causing the rest to quickly now follow in a sudden surprised rush. “DOES THIS COUNT AS A WAY OF DRYING OFF NOW??” Bendy shouted as they ran, everyone just followed Mugman who got to where there's a path to where some houses are and began to follow the path to somewhere, causing the rest to hurriedly follow along. Soon they then reached what seems like a house a bit further away from everyones just seeing Mugman quickly get a key from under one the pots in front of the house and unlocked the door quickly going in, causing the rest to follow inside now. </p>

<p>While heading inside the place looked quite tidy, and hasn't been destroyed at all it seems aside from one room having some objects knocked down and things around a bit messed up, must’ve been where a portal opened causing Mugman to fall through into that previous universe they all were in. While can see Mugman searching around the place shouting names that were unfamiliar as if he was searching for the people here, but he wasn’t having luck. Can see even Bendy go over to where he sees some photos are on the wall looking at ones that which for what can be seen of Mugman being in quite a bit of them with to guess his brothers in those photos too, one looking similar to Mugman just more red and the other looking quite different from the two but was considered family despite it for what one can see. “Sheesh, This is his family? They all look really happy..” Bendy mumbled a bit as he looked at the photos, can tell he felt bad for Mugman having difficulties finding them but also seems he just wishes he had some family of sorts, really reminds Brook of what he tried saying to her the one time when everyone split up and how he must’ve saw someone he knew as family, it’s a wonder what happened to them really. </p>

<p>“They all do look happy. Reminds me of me and my brother in some of these photos.” Sans spoke up as he went to look at the photos as well can tell he must be missing his brother it seems as he looked, he did kind of come along to help perhaps find his brother after all, but he hasn’t had much luck it seems, even now, it almost seems the reason got extra to it but who knows for sure. “How are you holding up with that anyways?. Knowing that your brother could be elsewhere somewhere?..” Bendy calmly asked, which can tell Sans was quiet once hearing that question, just seeing Sans stare at the photos there while he thought of an answer. “...He’s out there, just would take some time to find, but he has to be. Wouldn’t want another incident to happen anyways.” Sans finally replied but he said that quite quietly, making Bendy look at him with worry, can tell he wanted to help but he wasn’t sure how, but Brook did decide to speak up now for this matter. “Another incident shouldn’t happen, no matter what it is, because think you are powerful yourself that means your brother must be, no matter who he is, I know one of my brothers sure I can admit he may not be great at defending himself that much but he is capable of still doing so much so I know he will be okay, which I’m sure your brother must be the same way.” </p>

<p>Brook did go on as she stood nearby the other two which can tell Sans did look at her then the photos able to see he relaxed a bit now, which at least made everyone else around relax as well, as can hear Mugman running back down now which means they got someone else to help relax too. “I can’t find them! They aren’t anywhere in this house, they didn’t even leave a note at all! Oh no, what if something happened to them all?? What if they could’ve gotten hurt??” Mugman worriedly said while pacing a bit around which surely isn’t like Mugman to do, normally he is so calm about these things and looking to the bright side but right now he’s surely worried for his family. “Heyyyy it should be okay! Maybe they just went elsewhere more safe then here so no danger can find them wherever that is?” Bendy this time tried to comfort Mugman which Mugman looked to him still being a bit worried but calmed a little with that in mind. “Hm… True, It would make sense… But they could’ve left a hint to where! They have to! There has to be some hint as to where they could be!” Mugman exclaimed with worry in his tone but as he finished saying that everyone could hear a crash noise from somewhere in the house, which made the four look to where it was heard seeing one the doors but nothing else, perhaps it came from behind that door, which made everyone go quiet and not move. Except, Bendy didn’t seem that scared, just leading the way first as he went to it, causing the rest to follow, Sans getting a bone attack ready incase its danger and Mugman stuck near Brook incase for whatever it is as Brook made sure Mugman did still feel comforted about everything currently. </p>

<p>Soon they were just near the door, everyone mostly staring at it for any signs of anything, which seems Bendy was readying to be the one to open it surely seems. “Okay before anything… Mugman, what room is this normally?” Bendy asked quietly while he was readying to open it, Mugman perked his head up and looked to the door, still quietly a bit scared. “That’s the hallway closet… There isn’t really much in there normally so…” Mugman quietly answered as he stayed hidden near Brook. Bendy then once got an answer was now more ready, looking to the door, getting hold of the door knob and opening the door to just for Bendy to be startled and fall backwards for what looks like some Halloween decoration popping out from there, which startled the rest but not as much as Bendy it seems. “AH- CLOSET MONSTER- I HATE WHEN THOSE HAPPENS!” Bendy shouted while quickly going to where Sans is and grabbing the bone attack Sans had ready to aim it at the Halloween decoration, then it seems he realized it was just a decoration and not an actual person. </p>

<p>While what it actually seems the real person was staying hidden in there for can slightly see someone in there past it just can tell there remained hidden with some the hung up clothing in there but they were very noticeable in some way due to the green long sleeve for what one can see they’re wearing. “Hey… You know we can still see you’re in there… You don’t have to hide, we aren't a danger.” Brook spoke up, going over to the closet, which everyone looked at Brook confused which must mean they didn’t see the person was in there. “You’re not part of that group that’s been going around some universes?” Can hear a voice speak up from inside the closet, which Brook got closer to move the Halloween decoration more to the side so she can see who's in there. “No, In fact we are trying to stop that group if we are thinking about the same group.” Brook replied to what the person in the closet said which can see them now more properly once fully checking seeing that long sleeve green top and blue pants this person wore but it also seems they could be human just from another universe it surely seems clear, while they have the clear lack of hair aside from one strand of it, they do seem smart right away for what can be noticed though. </p>

<p>“What’s your name anyways?” Brook added on now once she got a proper view of this person in the closet now. “Baldi.” Can tell he looked to Brook more properly but didn’t step out from there just yet, but surely can’t blame him for she can notice everyone is staring in confusion but curiosity. “Well, Nice to meet you Baldi, I’m Brook and I’m sure the rest out here would like to meet you to so you’re not just known as closet guy” Brook smiled at Baldi, which she stepped back so Baldi can take a moment to step out as well, which the rest looked at him and gave a little wave to him as to say hello or so acknowledge his existence. “Hi! I’m Mugman! It’s nice to meet you Mr Baldi! Even if you were in the closet in my family's house..” Mugman already went over to give Baldi a nice warmer hello which seemed to surprise Baldi but can tell he didn’t mind just processing that information. “Soooo- Why were you in the closet?” “Bendy-” “WHAT??? IT’S A HONEST QUESTION TO ASK SANS!” Bendy shouted back at Sans after Sans had a response to Bendys question there, which Baldi looked to the two able to tell he wasn’t shy to answer that though. “I ended up in this place when there was this shadow like creature chasing me, Had quite the brute strength for how it was tearing through everything in its path, I was able to luckily be far enough ahead and winded up here, which then soon later you people shown up here which leads to now.” Baldi explained, able to tell at least Bendy did get the answer he wanted, just able to tell Bendy gave Sans the look of victory for this as he looked to Baldi with a smile now as he went over to him. “Well! Nice to meet you Baldi, as you must’ve put together I’m Bendy!” Bendy went to Baldi just giving a proper hello to him which at least made Sans at least seem relieved for that. </p>

<p>“And I’m Sans.” Sans now properly introduced himself as well, which Baldi looked to him and gave a nod as he looked to everyone, which can tell he seemed confused slightly now. “So, why are you all here anyways? Wouldn’t you be out there trying to stop that group going around?” Baldi asked, which made everyone look between one another and then to Mugman which Mugman did seem to have an answer ready. “Well… We only just got here and I recognize this place as I said to be my home. It's just I wanted to see if my family was here and there okay but they’re not here at all, sadly I don’t know where they could have gone at all…” Mugman explained as he looked at Baldi with an honest look, he is quite the honest guy after all. “Hm, well actually I think I may have an idea where they’ve gone, I remember when I got here I heard some voices coming from upstairs which I did hid for quite some time hearing some voices saying they got to go to the next isle they called it to hide there, but that’s all I mostly heard from that.” Baldi did go on to tell what he knew which as he was explaining can tell Mugmans eyes brightened with joy on hearing that which Mugman quickly went over to Baldi with a smile. “Perfect! That’s great to hear! Oh thank you so much! Hey- Wait, what if you come along with us???” “WHAT?? WOAH WOAH WOAH! WE AREN’T JUST GOING TO THROW INVITATIONS AROUND LIKE-” </p>

<p>“I mean I’m cool with it, he does seem quite smart perhaps he could have an idea where any of the groups have gone” Brook interrupted what Bendy had responded with to Mugmans offer, which Bendy looked at Brook confused then Mugman on about this but then he sighed now. “You know what? Alright! Well I’m cool with it too!” Bendy added as he looked to Sans waiting to see if he’d agree now. “Hm. Well, don’t get much say for it. I’m cool with it.” Sans added which he looked to Baldi who looked to everyone just seeming shocked and confused how everyone just quickly offered and made clear they all are cool with it which Baldi just was thinking then sighed. “Well, if this is going to help bring things back to normal, sure I will help you all, I may not be able to do much but if you see I can help with this then I will.” Baldi spoke up which made everyone cheer a bit once hearing that, more to the group that surely is being formed here but that’s surely good for it means they're all more prepared to face any dangers that could be ahead. “ALRIGHT! Okay so- what shall we start first?” “Help find Mugmans family, we can start with that while we wait to see if any parts of that group shows around while we’re here” Brook answered Bendys question while Bendy looked at her and gave a smile hearing that, which yet can notice Mugman get even happier hearing it. </p>

<p>“Okay! Then let’s go!” Mugman spoke up, seeming to know the way so he was quick to lead but quickly seems he made sure Baldi did follow which Baldi was confused and surprised but came along with anyways as the rest began to follow, they already got quite the group forming truly, which to think in Brooks view, perhaps they could all find Sonic and have a larger group now, so far it’s looking like quite the group with someone able to make methods, someone who is strong not fearing to face things, someone whos creative to think up the best things and now perhaps someone who could be really smart to help with any scenarios danger could be around in and if they find Sonic and if he joins they would have the speed. But surely it’s a wonder what her role is in all of this, sure she started this thing but feels she didn’t do too much now, what would it be? Oh well on that, for now focus on walking along with the rest for which seems all are already quick to question Baldi a lot. “Okay so- Do you come from another universe? What’s it like? Do you think there's bad people there? How’d you end up here? You got some tragic backstory?-” “OH! OH! I got one! How do you know there's a bad group??” “HEYY! GOOD ONE!” Bendy rambled but very much welcomed in Mugmans question once was said which Baldi was just looking at them all clearly not suspecting all these questions already. “Okay to start. Yes I come from another universe, it’s pretty normal despite it having some weird parts about it sometimes. There could be bad people everywhere hoping from each universe so I wouldn’t be surprised if there could be, at that how I learned them was hearing two people seemingly hiding but going on about it and being weird before one left and the other got more of those creatures to go around everywhere. Now I ended up here when a portal opened up below me trying to protect some people in my universe just so you know that too. Finally, why do you want to know if I had one?” </p>

<p>“I don’t know I mean- pretty sure everyone kind of does like- Mugman you got one??” Bendy asked which Mugman looked to Bendy and gave a worried look. “No I didn't, it's quite normal for it’s always been with my family and then me and my brother decided to stay with our grandpa so he isn’t alone as soon met our other brother” Mugman explained while Bendy stared at him before he sighed then looked at Sans. “Okay what about you Sans? You got one?” Bendy asked which caused Sans to look at him and seem to go silent then ahead now. “Don’t think any of us are at that level of opening up about this.” Sans spoke up while Bendy stared at him just seeming to have questions at him now. “You don’t have to be afraid to say like- Come on we’ve all been on this journey for a bit- HELL! I’ve been by you since the start of this mess since I ended up in your universe where I could've died but you helped and are basically my friend here! Honestly not many people do help you know, not even anyone in the universe I'm from.” Bendy spoke up, looking to Sans with worry but care which Sans looked to him just seeming a bit concerned now but not of what he said but of Bendy himself. “Well, what’s yours then Bendy?” “HEY BROOK YOU GOT A TRAGIC BACKSTORY?” Bendy quickly shouted that once Sans asked, Bendy quickly looked to Brook in hopes of some answer, but Brook wasn’t sure how to answer, she wasn’t sure how to at all. </p>

<p>“Wh… I… don’t know? What really considers something that’s happened to you to be a ‘tragic backstory’?” Brook questioned, which Bendy stared at her thinking for a moment then quickly spoke up now. “OKAY! So it could be either Sans or maybe Brook here who has one- Baldi. Come on, do you have something else to share???” “Well, I don’t mind saying that when younger I was made fun of? But it never has bugged me.” Baldi did end up speaking up on which Bendy seems now happy to get an answer during this walk now to wherever that Mugman was leading them too, as though it seems Sans wasn’t exactly happy. “Bendy you never spoke up if you had one.” Sans spoke up, causing Bendy to look over now. “What considers a-” “You’d know you asked the question to begin with.” Sans interrupted Bendy who tried saying what Brook said before which Bendy just sighed now, knowing he’d have to answer. “What considers being in a universe with a lot of death and pain and bad people going on in there?” Bendy asked, which caused everyone to just quietly look at him now, he’s said before how he wanted to escape a universe but being in one like that? To consider it sounds bad to be in no wonder why he wanted to escape. “Technically would count as a form of one.” </p>

<p>“Are you okay??? Oh I didn’t know that!” Mugman quickly went over to Bendy to hug after Baldi said the idea of what it could be, which seemed to surprise Bendy but he smiled even despite it all. “I’m Good! Sheesh I'm alright for it since this whole thing happened, plus I got to meet you guys! Now come on now that we all kind of shared with one another let’s get to that place Mugman said!” Bendy spoke up, giving Mugman a small hug back before letting go which Mugman did too as he quickly began to lead again, which everyone began to follow him now, which during it though, Brook did quietly go over to where Bendy is, which seems Bendy did notice, seeming a bit confused before Brook did speak up, she has to after what’s been said. “Hey… I do hope you're okay from all of this… Uhm… I know this may be a big thing to offer but, by the end of this all if you want you could always stay with me and perhaps my family too which i’m sure they won’t mind, just so you don’t have to go back there… okay?” Brook offered which Bendy stared at Brook once hearing that, then can see how quick he was to smile as he looked at Brook just moving more over to where she is. “I’d gladly take up that offer” Bendy replied, which at least now sets a way to relax knowing he’d not have to be back there in a universe like that, guess it really does now say that everyone here is becoming friends. </p>

<h5>Time goes on when everything feels it’s paused.</h5>
<h5>The blood still spills after hours have gone by. </h5>
<h5>If this is death why hasn’t it happened yet?  </h5>
<h5>If this isn’t death why can’t it be?. </h5>

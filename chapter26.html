<h2>Chapter 26. We’d Never Forget</h2>

<hr class="new3">

<p>“Do you see those stars?” A voice said, making the one person lying nearby sit up to look and see them pointing up at those beautiful blue stars on the ceiling of what is down here, which got the person to smile. “Yeah, I see them Bella.” The person answered, making this person known as Bella smile. “The stars… What do you think of looking at them?” Bella asked the person who looked to them to study and think, before looking back to her. “Well, I think of you. A beauty that shines in the darkness despite all that seems impossible.” The person answered sweetly, making Bella all warm in the face but smile brightly hearing it. “You’re so sweet… Hehe, I think stars can really remind you of others, kinda like how they remind me of your eyes… Just- unexpected beauties in the darkness of the underground here really…” Bella was staring at the stars kind of lost in thought before looking to the other again to admire looking at them a bit now. “Hehe, sorry that must’ve been weird to say…” She gave a gentle smile which made the other person smile sweetly back at her upon hearing it. “No, no, you’re good. It’s a nice thought to bring those good memories truly where you can imagine each shows a memory of a person, heh, like one there of maybe Papyrus actually managing to get you with one of his test traps and it was just a blast that day” The person pointed to one the stars moving closer to Bella to ensure they can see what they were seeing too. “Hehe, I remember it really catching me off guard but it was fun despite knowing that it was just a harmless test..” Bella smiled moving closer to the person as well to see where they may see too which yet makes this all the more enjoyable. </p>

<p>“You know… if we ever miss one another, if we have to go out somewhere at all and be without the other even, we can always look at the stars to remember… If- that does make sense…” Bella looked at the person who was looking to the stars then looked at Bella now. “It does make sense Bells. The stars… a reminder of all that’s good and even a reminder of amazing people we got in our lives.” The person smiled at Bella who smiled back while both were lost looking at the other happily and enjoying the closeness they yet got, moments like these that feel they can never end. Being in a place where you may never see the sun but yet, you still can experience all the beauties of a world so large like this with someone you yet never expected to fall in love with from the start, making this world all the more colorful because of it. </p>


<hr class="new3">

<p>As portals were opening abouts on the ceiling and walls even some on the floor which Sans swiftly dodged one as the group walked on, hearing some forms of conversation that didn’t make much sense aside from being clear all of them are really bonding seeing how it seems Sonic and Mugman are getting close and becoming really good friends for how they talk and Baldi watching and chirping in at times to his amusement to seeing it while Jevil tries to harp in and match the energy more but sometimes goes a little much where Brook settles Jevil down which luckily seems Jevil listens to not just Sans now for that, but wait, where abouts is Bendy? Which yet made Sans glance around before hearing a “You good?” Which, turning where he heard it he saw Bendy beside Sans now with a worried expression on his face. “Yeah, I’m alright. Why do you ask?” Sans looked to Bendy curious which Bendy seemed to not really believe it when he said alright but yet carried on to answer what Sans asked anyway. “It’s just well- you keep looking like you're thinking about something that each time you seem hurt by whatever you are thinking about you know?? So that’s why I wanted to check since- it’s right to, you know?” Bendy explained his reasonings for concern which yet made Sans pause to think for a moment on how to answer him, which a thought came back while doing so, ‘if we all are friends technically, we got to all look out for each other.’ Although it's what Brook said to let him at least know it’s okay to talk to her, maybe, it could be applied to everyone here, just this once. “...Do you.. Ever miss those old memories of times when stuff was perfect?” Sans asked but kept his voice lower so nobody else would have to overhear them. “Well in a way yeah. Just times where you don’t have to worry for where you are but more so the joy you get from it..” Bendy answered but also kept his voice lower getting the memo on why Sans was keeping his lower here. “Have you… ever lost who… Ah nevermind, we should be focused on what’s going on here.” Sans quickly went ahead to try to focus but then felt Bendy gently touch his shoulder causing Sans to look over seeing Bendy still was worried maybe even more but they also seemed to have an answer to what Sans was yet going to say. “Sans.. I- I never knew you had to go through that… Look I know loss is painful, I too well- lost someone in a way but- i don’t think that's a good comparison now is it?.. But, for whoever it was, I believe what they’d want for you now is to- be happy, enjoy what you have now, don’t let it drag you into the darkness…” </p>

<p>Bendy still kept his tone lowered while Sans listened in to it all, seeming to think before suddenly both Bendy and Sans heard someone step beside Sans as if they were able to hear the whole thing which they saw was Jevil who was well- surprisingly calmer this time around. “I COULDN’T HELP,HELP BUT OVERHEAR AND.. YOU KNOW,KNOW IT'S TOUGH SUCH A THING,THING! HAVING TO SEE SUCH,SUCH THINGS WHEN ALL YOU CAN DO,DO IS WATCH ANGRY OR UPSET,UPSET! …IT’S NOT NICE I KNOW… BUT,BUT- DON’T LET THAT HOLD,HOLD YOU BACK DURING TOUGH,TOUGH TIMES! LET IT FUEl,FUEL YOU TO FIGHT,FIGHT! AT LEAST- FUEL IN DOING SOMETHING GOOD,GOOD..” Jevil as well tried to cheer them up a little seeming to even show they as well get the pain maybe even experienced something similar judging by how they were with this topic, which really does leave Sans to think now on what both of them have told him which he winded up cracking a small smile looking to both Bendy and Jevil now. “Heh, thanks you two.” Sans spoke up which Jevil smiled widely once seeing it laughing but more so in joy which yet Bendy smiled as well seeing that reaction seeing now that Sans must’ve really opened up and has accepted them all now. Though it was briefly interrupted when Jevil nearly slipped into a portal which Sans had quickly caught Jevil from nearly falling in and brought them away from it now, which honestly gives a bit of a chance to look at these portals. </p>

<p>Each portal seemed surely different from each other, one looks to focus on a field of some kind with a cloudy sky and can half see a castle in the distance of it, another portal though had a more barren wasteland where it seems battles are going on within it, then another seeming to be almost far more futuristic and is really lit up for the nighttime it seems to be for it, which yet now really does bring into question what time even is it for anywhere now? Hopefully they won’t be late for whenever everyone goes back to wherever that universe is, yet they surely need to figure out what it is and how they can get to it to hopefully stop where the source of all of this is coming from. “You know, looking at some of these universes guys, I think I have visited some of these before! Which really leaves so many surprises for what you can find at each one of these” Sonic spoke up which yet brought in everyone's attention for what he has yet to say. “So do you have any idea what universe these guys we’ve been seeing are from??” Baldi asked everyone which Sonic was about to answer, paused to think and looked down a bit disappointed which made it clear he did not have an answer for that. “Well, I don’t have an answer for that, They just seem confusing to really figure out where they could’ve come from, so we still gotta find Nuqx somewhere here to figure that out.” Sonic answered which yet makes it clear they simply got to find where Nuqx is even if it is difficult it’s one the ways they can get answers here to ensure they can stop this madness. As the group went on dodging portals that opened up from up here they finally reached this spot where there was one single bit of light in this darkened hallway up ahead where can see Nuqx was looking around seeming to search for something or maybe get away from something, seeming to look over seeing the group and paused upon seeing them, well, might as well try their best to go abouts this now to make sure Nuqx wouldn’t run. “Nuqx, are you okay?..” Brook spoke up for the group, stepping a bit forward which made Nuqx step back, but yet Mugman joined in to help out in this matter. “It’s okay! It’s just us here! We won’t do anything bad!” Mugman spoke up as well, giving a gentle smile to Nuqx who only looked back able to tell they were thinking on what to do here. “We just got a small few questions to ask you Nuqx since everyone else is quite busy as of right now.” Sans added in keeping his voice calm as well to just be a bit of a backup assist in this which yet Nuqx stared on at the group thinking before looking to seemingly behind them as if to check something now which yet made this situation a little worrisome for who knows whenever a danger could be coming to get them. </p>

<p>Once there was a sign of nothing dangerous to come they took a moment to breathe and looked to them as if to wait and see if they got anything more to say which is yet a good sign. “For this group you're in, what is this universe you guys came from? If we are going to want to stop this stuff we are going to need to know where.” Baldi spoke up to ask the question for everyone which Nuqx stared on giving back an expression that seemed he didn’t want to answer or perhaps remembered something that yet makes him seem hesitant upon answering this question, although sure a simple question, why are they so unsure? “Look you guys... Wouldn’t want to be there right now since its-” “COME ONNN! TELL, TELL US! WHAT'S SO BAD,BAD ABOUT A SILLY OTHER WORLD,WORLD TO WRECK A LITTLE- WELL- HELP FROM HAVOC,HAVOC!” Jevil interrupted Nuqx making Nuqx seem more unsure which Jevil looked to the rest getting glances of they were making some progress who knows now for how much they are making progress now, though yet Brook decided to step in to speak up again. “Nuqx, we know things are bound to be likely dangerous but we want to stop this. We want to help the best we can, at least if we can get these portals gone so nobody gets hurt again then that’s fine with us, but please, you are one of the only other members we can reach in that group to get an answer to this. “Brook did her best to be clear which Nuqx only stared on seeming to be thinking before looking down, who knows if that worked but can feel Bendy gave a little tap on the shoulder to say she did a good effort trying which before Brook could thank him that's when Nuqx spoke up now. </p>

<p>“It’s a universe called the Inbetween universe.. A universe with- many many people of sorts versus some of these ones.. Really a colorful one if it weren’t for what's going on..” Nuqx went on to explain the best he could to the group, which yet this really gave the group now a hope to find it, perfect! They just need to get there to stop this, they should have most of the group handled now after all if they can just find the portal and go in they’d be able to stop this madness. “Are there any portals here you think that could take us there or be close enough for us to get there?” Sans asked but before Nuqx could answer can hear a crash from somewhere, which seeing Jevil and Sonic quickly go to check ahead as Nuqx seemed to figure out who it was but looked to the group gesturing them to follow which they did while Jevil and Sonic are going to hopefully deal with whatever that crash was, hopefully they aren’t all in danger already again. The group followed Nuqx on, having to be careful of each portal they go by until Nuqx stops them at some that are around and looks to each of them as if to check if they remember any of these leading to somewhere before they then look to the rest. “I’m sure one of these should get you close to there but… Sadly I’m not sure which one exactly..” Nuqx spoke up looking to the group which they nodded in appreciation for the help before another loud crash was heard and yelling from someone angry as hearing attacks be thrown at the yelling to, oh no, it’s Clubtacka, who's already catching up to them. “Oh no! How are we supposed to find the portal at this rate now??” Mugman asked worriedly which yet quickly Baldi went in to start standing near each portal to see if there's clues to wherever it could be which Brook went in to do the same as for Sans and Bendy looked to the door seeming to agree to go help out which Bendy went right away to go do so but Sans stopped to look at Mugman. “You guys search, we’ll try to slow them down. Okay?” Sans asked if Mugman can do that, making it clear what the idea is which Mugman nodded and began to search right away as Sans now left to go help out as well in the matter. </p>

<hr class="new2">

<p>Attacks kept on being thrown, Jevil quickly slashing his scythe around after Clubtackas each swing while Sonic quickly hit them away and off when stuff got tough or to get them off guard. Which Clubtacka quickly charged towards at Jevil and Sonic but Jevil quickly shielded them both with multiple suits acting like a shield, angering Clubtacka even more because of such a thing, quickly tearing it down with multiple swings but gave Sonic the opening to hit Clubtacka back right when so they won’t be hurt. Which as Clubtacka was hit back they began to charge at Sonic who quickly kept on holding them off now, while Jevil was readying to charge in they overheard people approaching, causing them to look and see Sans and Bendy coming over dodging portals seeing how both were preparing some attacks which Jevil leaded them to where Clubtacka is but swiftly had to dodge Sonic being shot right by them from a swing of Clubtackas club. “QUIT GETTING IN MY WAY!” Clubtacka screamed, charging at Jevil but quickly Sans summoned bones in front of them before summoning a blaster to shoot at Clubtacka which while Clubtacka dodged Bendy stuck by the beam of the blast to follow it along to reach Clubtacka faster and hit them further away. Jevil then quickly began to charge in as well to swing at Clubtacka managing to get a few hits before Clubtacka hit them off but gave Sonic who gotten back up quickly an opening to hit Clubtacka down as well leaving Clubtacka even more further back taking a moment to breathe as the four stood blocking the way for where it could lead to the rest. “Alright! That oughta take care of you!” Sonic remarked, looking back to where the rest could be then to the rest who are here to see if it’s time to go back. </p>

<p>“You go on ahead and help the rest out! We’ll be here keeping an eye on Clubtacka!” Bendy told Sonic who nodded seeming to go do so now within a quick dash which yet the three continued to watch Clubtacka who tried to get back up readying there club but fell back down, which Bendy went over to stand nearby Clubtacka taking the club they had so they can't do much of anything else now. “YOU GIVE THAT BACK NOW!” Clubtacka screamed trying to swing at Bendy with there hands but Sans used their bone powers to block it for Bendy while they kept hold of the club. “You ain’t getting it back!” Bendy spoke back, looking to see Sans and Jevil which- they paused once seeing Jevil though seeming to stare at this matter lost in thought, but they didn’t have much of a grin no, and usually there is the one who always is grinning, why not now? Hopefully this isn’t something bad. Sans caught on noticing what was going on, looking to Bendy giving a look that says to keep an eye on Clubtacka for a moment while he figures out what's going on, Bendy gave a nod continuing now to keep an eye on Clubtacka as Sans now began to check whats up. “Are you okay Jevil?” Sans asked keeping his tone low so it doesn’t bother what Bendy is focused on doing or risk Clubtacka trying to find an opening with this. Jevil then perked his head up looking at Sans though a grin hasn’t yet formed making this less reassuring for trying to figure if everything is exactly okay. “HM? OH,OH! YES,YES! JUST THINKING,THINKING” Jevil answered which yet didn’t reassure Sans really from such a reaction like that. “You.. sure?” Sans asked which Jevil stared at Sans hearing that be asked seeming to think of some form of a way to answer that as can tell he wasn’t expecting them to still be curious, which before he could answer can hear an angered yell from Clubtacka having got up and is already trying to fight Bendy to get the club back while Bendy does his best to keep them off, making Sans and Jevil quickly take action now to where Sans quickly blocks Clubtacka off from reaching Bendy while Jevil charges in with his scythe to knock Clubtacka further back in a fast swing, making Clubtacka stumble back further away from the rest but allowed for an opening for them to whistle seeing COTS come seeping in from around now to try and stop the three, which quickly Bendy came dashing in to strike each the COTS down first while Sans followed suit leaving Jevil to be the one to ensure Clubtacka stays back which Clubtacka was right away charging ahead to try and get by but Jevil quickly threw up a suit wall and swung at Clubtacka to launch them back which Clubtacka went back at first but quickly came back dodging a swing and tackling Jevil from the side to knock them down, though as a fast response Jevil turned into the scyth to hit Clubtacka off them in a fast spin before transforming right back now taking the wall of suits to launch at Clubtacka now to keep them further back. </p>

<p>Which gave Sans the opening to step in as well and block off the way instead to let Jevil go on ahead to charge at Clubtacka which Clubtacka was charging right back, though gave Bendy the opening to hit them with their own club right into Jevil which allowed Jevil to swing at them to knock them right back down. Quickly Jevil then kept them down with their scythe making it clear if they try to get up again there not afraid to do what they need to which did at least make Clubtacka stay where they are for now. “Well! We all really make a good team hehe!” Bendy spoke up once they got Clubtacka down for right now which got Jevil to laugh upon hearing it that half maniac laugh but it was more so a laugh that showed perhaps a joy hearing such a thing. “OHH! HEHE! TEAMWORK,TEAMWORK TRULY! HAHA! WHO KNEW,KNEW SUCH A THING WOULD BE SO FUN,FUN TO HAVE??” Jevil looked to Bendy smiling while kicking Clubtackas hand away from trying to take the scythe making Jevil hold it closer to Clubtacka as a threat for them to not try. “Don’t say you’ve won just yet now!” Clubtacka spoke up which caused the three to look at them while Jevil was the one to quickly laugh at this. “OH PLEASE, PLEASE! YOU'RE THE ONE IN OUR,OUR GRASP NOW!” Jevil spoke up holding the scythe closer but this time Clubtacka didn’t seem threatened by such a thing now for some reason, why so? Suddenly that's when a portal opened from under them causing Clubtacka and Jevil to drop in suddenly which yet quickly made Sans and Bendy go quickly over to look into the portal for a moment trying to see what’s on the other side but it's hard to though quickly Sans put his hand in knowing it should keep the portal open before he looked to Bendy now. </p>

<p>“Go get the rest, If this is the game they’re going to play they could take us right to the universe.” Sans spoke up which Bendy nodded quickly as Sans took the bone wall down so he can get to them as for now Sans ensured the portal stayed open, hopefully Jevil is able to keep a fight going whilst in there. While Bendy was quickly going through the halls, taking several turns remembering the way back with ease and once they were turning into one the halls they hit right into what felt like an invisible wall again. Oh great, him again. “Ezose! Look, you need to take this wall down now!” Bendy spoke up turing to figure exactly where Ezose is seeing Ezose but, they didn’t seem to have any bad intentions seeing there expression was more so concerned here. “It wouldn’t be a good idea to go out that way, there's more portals opening there that it is at risk of becoming something terrible.” Ezose spoke up which yet Bendy seemed to not enjoy hearing that. “BUT THE REST ARE THAT WAY! I can’t leave them there! At least how about you be some help here since if we’re going to save these places and you guys you’re gonna have to give up the “ohh boss!” gig and come help us out! Alright?? AT THAT! Isn’t one of your friends back with my friends??” Bendy snapped back going to Ezose but yet, settled a bit once near as it’s best to be at least somewhat calm about situations like these. Ezose then looked to Bendy thinking about what was yet said before letting out a sigh and took the wall down it seemed and looked to Bendy now. “Lead the way to them, I will do what I can to ensure we get there safely and out there safely. I’d need to practice this anyway for later today.” Ezose spoke up seeming to prepare to do any sorts of magic which Bendy smiled hearing it before quickly leading the way now with Ezose following behind taking quick turns each time as can see the area was getting more and more portals around causing the two to have to dodge them more, luckily Ezose kept using magic to boost them up past through certain areas with a lot of portals so they both can get by till they reached where the rest should be seeing Sonic dashing around where the door is checking each portal around before then looking to see the two and seemed confused why it was just Bendy and let alone Ezose was with them too. “Hey! Where's the other two??” Sonic asked which quickly Bendy answered while getting over to where Sonic was as Ezose stayed put. “We gotta go now! Look Clubtacka got here and opened some portal Sans is keeping open and they took Jevil to go in with her! For what Ezose here told me that it's only getting worse over here too!” Bendy quickly explained by opening the door to the room the rest were in which can see everyone was checking portal after portal even seeing Nuqx try to help the group out before Bendy whistled them all over getting their attention to be put towards him. </p>

<p>“Come on! We got to go now! Jevil needs our help and who knows if Clubtacka tries to escape on us again!” Bendy spoke up. Making the rest quickly get up to get going now except Nuqx who watched on unsure, which as Bendy was going to speak that's when Ezose came by to assist. “Come on Nuqx, it’s getting bad over here” Ezose spoke up seeing Nuqx nod once hearing and seeing Ezose, going over with though keeping their distance as can see Sonic already helping everyone cross by some the portals, seeing him help Mugman over first, then Brook, then was about to help out Baldi before both nearly stumbled right into a portal as well, yeah this areas getting bad. Quickly Ezose stepped in to us magic to get those two across along with him, Nuqx and Bendy that once over quickly the group had to dodge another portal opening up near them, causing them all to quickly then begin to go onwards, quickly working together to get by each spot like Brook giving Mugman a lift over some rougher spots which leads to Bendy helping Brook get by rougher patches as Baldi helped Nuqx get through some spots without problem while Sonic was the backup for if there was a problem to occur while Ezose was focused on getting everyone out of there safely. Portals though only continued to open up more around that made it all the more challenging to figure a way through, though quickly Brook to lead seeming to figure routes to get by to safety with assistance on idea where to go and turn to, which made it easier for everyone to work together to get by that luckily they all got out from there through the several challenges that was there, which everyone took a moment to catch there breath now once they did get out from there. </p>

<p>By surprise they got through, who knows how but they did, which yet Sonic was quick to loudly cheer they got out from that which yet caused the portals that were behind them to have several COTS peaking in to check the noise now, uh oh, how can they forget about that. “Real clever Sonic, realllll clever.” Baldi spoke up which Sonic looked over to the rest with a little chuckle before hearing the COTS all roar, making the group get right back into running though seeing Ezose and Nuqx take a separate way but do what they can to lure most the COTS away which is helpful of them to do, which the rest quickly continued to run, taking quick turns while Mugman tried to shoot at them but had no luck while Sonic tried to attack them while they ran but yet there was still so many COTS. Soon they then reached the area for whereabouts Sans was seeing him keep the portal open though can see him throwing attacks in as if to try and help whatever battle is going on there before seeming to notice the rest coming by seeing them be chased which he quickly formed a bone wall once the group entered in causing a lot of the COTS to run right into it, that should slow the COTS down for the time being. “OKAY! COME ON GUYS! WE’RE GOING INTO THE PORTAL!” “Woah! Woah! What about the rest??” Sans asked once Bendy spoke up the idea in mind while going over to where Sans is. “Look! If Clubtacka is still in there we still have a chance to stop them like we did with the rest of the group!” Bendy explained, seeming ready to hop into the portal whenever. “It's fair reasoning, back over where we were, portals are only getting worse, so let's go.” Baldi then went over to ready as well seeing Sonic and Mugman follow though Brook was taking a second to study each the COTS being held back by the bone wall  before looking to the rest, seeing them all ready then went over to gather around the portal with, Sans holding it open still for everyone, seeing everyone get any attacks at the ready before seeing Bendy go in first, then Sonic, then Baldi and Mugman then Brook soon followed after as Sans took the bone wall down and hopped in along with, as the portal then closed behind them while the COTS charged over  but yet there was no success in getting to the group, leaving nothing but portals to be opened around and a darkness that consumes. </p>

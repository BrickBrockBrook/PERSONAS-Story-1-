<h2>Chapter 11. Split Up</h2>

 <p>“Brook! Bendy!” Mugman shouted out while walking along the path with Sans who was checking around as well, trying to search for the two but there was no sign of them. “Think we’re too far from the two Mugman, who knows if they will even take the same path as we are.” Sans spoke up, making Mugman look over and listen to this information. “Well, we have to have hope though! We got to believe that they will go a similar path and we all would meet again! Which I’m sure they will think of taking this way because that’s where this Alovo guy is going for the direction!” Mugman spoke with quite a hopeful tone, surely making Sans think on what was said for that as the two continued walking onward looking for any signs for if the two are around or ahead but yet there was none. </p>

<p>Sans checked around the area looking for signs while Mugman was going ahead for they are yet far more faster then him as he checked around, no signs of the two around but just the forest that yet seemed the area was growing more rocky appearing to be a stone blue coloration, perhaps they are coming up on a mountain or cave like location which checking ahead it did in some sense seem there was a cave ahead, which Mugman slowed down upon seeing it. “Oh… Uhm… It looks dark in there…” Mugman spoke with a scaredish tone in his voice, which made Sans look at Mugman once hearing that. “Don’t worry Mugman, it should be just a small cave, if it goes too far we can turn back and find another way.” Sans said, looking at Mugman who looked back and smiled not seeming so scared or worried about it now while Sans began to take the lead now into entering this odd cave of sorts that was yet ahead while Mugman followed. </p>

<p>The cave although it appeared dark outside wasn’t as bad once really inside for how it did lighten quite a bit up in an odd way but still was quite dark for Sans and Mugman to traverse but Sans leaded ready for if he needs to summon an attack while Mugman followed ready to use what he called his finger gun for if danger were to come towards them but so far there was no danger, just, silence. Anywhere they scoured it was all mostly of those rocks of sorts with the same coloration, some rocks darker in other parts of the area not as a shadow but just a different shade while there was cracks around of course but some had an odd black goop come out from them which seems to have cause discomfort for Mugman whilst going through here with Sans. “Uhm… Sans? Isn’t this a little… scary?...” Mugman asked with a fearful tone of the area while he stuck close by to Sans who wasn’t really scared by it but had his concerns on it. </p>

<p>“More unnerving, but, can see what you mean” Sans answered, checking the area for any signs of danger but there has been none to be seen. “You know, you're brave for not fearing going into here, kind of like my one brother who was always the brave and courageous one…” Mugman mentioned which made Sans go silent upon hearing that, causing him to quietly think on it while continuing onward while Mugman followed closely behind. Though while walking, Mugman was able to notice Sans grow into thought for what he had said for how he seemed to grow more focused on continuing ahead and wasn’t really saying anything making Mugman grow with worry upon seeing it. “...Sans? Are you doing alright? Are you perhaps worried that we won’t find the rest?...” Mugman asked, which seemed to catch Sans by surprise, making him look over to Mugman a bit with a slight look of confusion. </p>

<p>“What? Well… I’m alright and I’m not worried about that.” “Oh! Well you must be sure that we can find them then and that they will be alright, it’s good to think positive like that Sans!” Mugman smiled while he responded to what Sans had said, looking around the area growing not too scared of it now which yet made Sans quite curious by what had been said. “It’s a bit odd how you can be pretty positive like this, isn’t this scary for someone even your age?” Sans asked now, which Mugman seemed to be a bit confused but then understood what he meant now. “Oh! Well from the universe i’m from there always can be positive sides to things even when you could get into tough situations rather you or another puts you into, even if i’m a bit younger than you I don’t think it should affect who you are and how you may view different things!” Mugman answered which Sans quietly listened in to it all while it appeared the cave was growing darker now perhaps they could be nearing a darker spot within the cave or it could be hinting a closer way out from here. </p>

<p>“Hm, should surely listen to you for that one then, heh, probably smarter than me for that.” “Aw! That’s really nice of you to say Sans! Though you’re still smart, more smart than me for different subjects I think like math! I’m not the best in that but I think you are though!” Mugman responded when hearing Sans’s remark, continuing onward with him while they go through into the darker areas of this cave of sorts. Further walking on can then soon come upon into an area that’s full of what seems like white crystals all along the walls and onward ahead showed an open way out from the cave that yet gave a great view of the sky from where they stood seeing what could make out to be stars within the sky and the open forest that's ahead able to see a slight path ahead for a way to go even can see an intersection where two pathways meet, a reasonable spot to head to as to find the rest at. </p>

<p>“Wow! This place is stunning! Oh this is such an amazing place, I think my brothers would like this place like when we explored back home!” Mugman spoke with amazement to it all, going ahead to look at some of the crystals but yet looked to the opening to look up to the sky out there which Sans followed along before standing beside to look up to the sky as well.  “Isn’t it nice Sans?” Mugman asks now once saw Sans come over but can see how he was silent from it which made Mugman grow worried upon seeing it now. “Sans?... You okay?...” “...Yeah, just, thinking, I think my brother would’ve really enjoyed seeing this too.” Sans finally answered Mugmans who still was in some way worried even if he got an answer. “...Did something happen to your brother?” Mugman asked quietly, keeping calm so it wouldn't stress Sans out, which Sans seemed to be quietly thinking what was asked before he looked down.</p>

<p>“...Yeah, when this portal stuff began… I was home with my brother and it happened quickly but before I could do much he fell into a portal and closed up before I could save him, I have no idea now for where he could even be which while searching for what portal to find what universe he could have fallen into that’s when I found Bendy knocked out cold in the snow.” Sans explained now while Mugman quietly listened in to it all feeling bad for him for how this all yet happened, perhaps it answers why he came along even, in hopes to find his brother. “Sans… I… didn't know that happened to you… I’m really sorry that had to happen, but, I think we can find your brother, he should be okay and since you're really strong I’m sure your brother must be able to defend himself and he must be looking for you as well!” Mugman said, which made Sans grow silent hearing that advice and seemed to look to him a bit then to the sky again. </p>

<p>“Hm, I guess, just a bit tough when you lost someone way before this, but, you make a fair point… Thanks Mugman…” “Your welcome Sans! I couldn’t leave you thinking like that, it can be a lot for you, like for one of my brothers, before we had him with us he worries a lot to lose us, but, what we always told him is that we will do anything we can to keep going and find them again which it does really help him out for that knowing he won’t lose anyone else!” Mugman added to try and help Sans know he does understand in some way which Sans quietly listened to while he relaxed and settled down a lot more due to there being a less amount of stress now once he was able to at least tell someone a bit for what’s been bothering him, can really make you think in some way now about all that’s happened to lead to this point. “Alright! Maybe we should continue on though, that way we can find the rest and continue on finding a way to stop this! Maybe even find our brothers along the way!” Mugman spoke, which Sans nodded his head to, getting ready to get going onward so they could continue on to where they planned to go. Mugman then began to look around and found a way down from where they are so leaded Sans the way onward down, which Mugman let Sans go first who was taking his time to get down while Mugman followed who also took there time to try and climb on down to the path below so they can reach that intersection they saw to hopefully find the other two there. </p>

<p>Once Sans got down, he watched to see Mugman coming down who seemed to be taking their time but it seemed one the rocks suddenly gave out that he got hold of making him slip, which Sans reacted fast quickly summoning a blaster to come by and catch Mugman quickly before he could get hurt, which although Mugman was scared for a second once realizing he was caught he calmed down now knowing Sans was the one who did in some way while he got placed down to the ground. “Thank you Sans! I thought I would’ve cracked my handle more there or any more of my head! You’re really a hero! Now come on! Let’s go!” Mugman spoke giving Sans a smile and complimenting him before continuing onward but made sure Sans followed with which Sans thought for a moment on what was said while he made the blaster vanish, before he then began to follow focused on finding the other two again who could be out here. </p>

<hr class="new2">

<p>“So that’s what your brothers did!?? Sheesh! Didn’t know siblings can be quite crazy like that!” Bendy exclaimed which Brook laughed a bit upon hearing that while Bendy looked at her confused but smiled seeing her laugh. “Well, that’s having brothers can sometimes be like even when there pretty opposite of one another, but even then they still are family and we all will look after one another at the end of the day” Brook answered, while looking ahead as they walked on which Bendy followed with, studying the area as they did so but was mostly focused on what Brook had to say. “Huh, you know, hearing all of that reminds me of someone I met that the more I think me and that person were famil-” Though while Bendy was saying that he suddenly tripped on one the rocks that were scattered around the area and fell face first which made Brook quickly rush over to where he was to check if he was okay. </p>

<p>“Bendy?? Are you okay??” “I’M ALRIGHT! Just a little injured but I’m alllll good!” Bendy answered the worried Brook, getting himself up quickly to realize his leg was clearly bleeding a bit now with this red and inky mixture but it seems he wasn’t worried by it. “Uhm, Bendy your-” “Oh don’t worry! Don’t worry! I know just how to fix this!” Bendy interrupted to try and reassure Brook about it, which confused Brook for what he means by that truly. Bendy then began to study the injury and can see the inky mixture on his back bubble a bit through and can see the ink go over it and patch it up in seconds as once done he looked to Brook now to show he was all good. “How did you do that??” Brook asked, looking at Bendy with quite the surprised look seeing Bendy get up just fine with a smile. </p>

<p>“Ink healing powers! Comes to use for any recent injuries I got on me so it can be patched up in no time!” “Really? Even that injury that’s been on your face for a while?” Brook asked which Bendy stared at her upon hearing that as if only now he had learned there was an injury on his face. “Shoot- I didn’t know there was- that’s- a situation, If it’s been there for a while then that means I can’t heal it, Quite bad I know even when I can’t heal others with it” Bendy explained which Brook studied him, thinking on what was said for his whole ink healing power. “Oh, but either way it’s good to have, though why does your back bubble when you do that and not your hand if that isn’t odd to ask?” Brook asked another question to Bendy who wasn’t bothered but gave a smile upon hearing it for how she was curious about it which could be good to know either way. “That’s where the source is! Yeah it’s weird how the back is the source for it but that’s where the most ink is, so when it does that it’s working it’s magic!” Bendy answered now, giving a smile which Brook nodded her head to show understanding and show she is keeping it in mind for when it comes to anything. </p>

<p>“That’s interesting really.” “Yeah! You know it makes me wonder how come you as a human don’t have powers yet? I mean for what I know of them is that they are intelligent beings that can create some of the wildest and deadliest things but yet without any powers though, so how is it you don’t yet?” Bendy asked now, which Brook began to think and wonder on a bit now for once it was said. “I’m not sure, I guess are bodies just- can’t?” “Just can’t??? Well I think if you were to have some powers it would be some the bestest powers yet to stop this madness and are the most helpful to everyone here” Bendy exclaimed, continuing on ahead of Brook and walking backwards even without fear to show how he is confident of it all and believes in some things that yet are impossible clearly, with no fear of falling again clearly. </p>

<p>“Hehe, you’re really nice for saying that Bendy” Brook now exclaimed which Bendy smiled upon hearing before turning back around to look on ahead then seeing him get excited seeing what’s ahead and looking to Brook. What seemed to be ahead was what looked like a odd pathway that had the trees around it fade into a deep purple with darkness coming from there that felt off to Brook but then felt Bendy suddenly quickly get hold of her wrist to quickly pull her along onward to there having no fear of it but the excitement on what could be found. Going onward into this darkness that had the trees go into a deep purple and the ground looked of a deep blue now as they went on only having the idea of a path to guide them through this part of the odd forest they’re in.  </p>

<p>“Bendy? Are you sure this place is safe?” Brook asked, looking at Bendy as they walked on within this darkened area which Bendy looked a bit back at her giving a reassuring smile upon hearing that. “Brook don’t worry! The darkness could be scary but you can always find something out of it all once you get through it! That’s what someone used to tell me before they went elsewhere” Bendy said while trying to let that be a way of having some comfort about all of this, which did help a little to give some comfort. Continuing on was yet some more darkness throughout the area until slowly it opened up more to a larger darkened area but looking up can see what appears like so many stars all around that is unknown if real or not or if it's night or somehow day, but yet seeing it with those purples and blues of the forest mixed in the sky faintly made it all the more stunning to see, the thing they found when in this darkness truly which did make both Bendy and Brook stop to look up to it all. </p>

<p>“Now look at that beauty!” “Yeah, no kidding, it really is a beauty to see…” Brook added to what Bendy exclaimed, looking up to all the possible stars up in the sky here in this place. “Yeah know, finally having a chance to look at these things makes me think of something, I think stars could be almost a way that represents every single universe that is out there that we could all find together which if that’s the case then sheesh there is going to be a lot to find!” Bendy said while looking at all the stars then looked over to Brook now who paused hearing that. That sounded almost familiar hearing that truly, but she isn’t sure why it was so familiar hearing Bendy say that, ‘Each star represents a universe’, Well the interpretation really does make sense, in a strange way though. <em>Young one…</em> </p>

<p>“Uh- Brook you alright? You're spacing off more than the space out here!” “Wh- Oh, I’m all good, just, thinking a bit on what you said, it really does make a lot of sense for stars to mean that” Brook answered quickly to what Bendy had asked, who still looked at her with a concerned look of sorts to this but he decided not to budge about it. “Well, to think otherwise, I wonder what universe that other person you said you were with at the beginning of all of this could be in?” Bendy asked in a way while he wondered on it which got Brook to wonder on such a thing as well here. “I wish I knew, I’m not sure if they went into a portal even or just are waiting there handling things.” Brook answered his question now, looking to the sky for any clues perhaps, it always felt looking at the sky things could be answered for her after all. “Well I think they are out there! They had to have gone searching for you here or even searching for some spot both of you end up meeting to stop this portal chaos! I think even they will be surely impressed to see how much you’ve learned by then.” Bendy explained, going over closer to Brook while giving her a gentle smile to reassure her about all of this, which made Brook look back and give a smile as well. </p>

<p>“Thanks Bendy… Now, let’s see if there are any spots ahead we can go to as a way to meet the rest there!” Brook responded, which made both Brook and Bendy look out to the area now while going a bit onward to look for any ideas to potentially find the rest at, which seems Bendy had noticed something. “AH HAH! There! There's what looks like an intersection for two pathways to meet! Quite the coincidence if I say so myself! Come on Brook! The many universes need us!” Bendy exclaimed, while looking at Brook who gave a nod as Bendy quickly went on ahead as she quickly ran behind going to where he was. The area that was yet so dark didn’t really seem dark now after that, going through it together is what made it brighter until they were out from that darkened section and can carry on through the forest it was like before just hurrying onward to reach that interaction so they can meet and see if they could have catched up with the one fellow. </p>

<p>The two continued onward, going along a path to see that intersection ahead of them which yet Bendy who was walking beside Brook during this began to suddenly run shouting “RACE YEAH!” before dashing ahead which made Brook begin to run right after him with a smile to try and catch up with him quickly, managing to keep up close till they were beside one another as then Brook managed to get a further more ahead which made Bendy act fast to suddenly melt into a puddle and zoom a bit ahead like that and popped out from it, surely is clever for that. But yet Brook continued to run trying to pick up the pace to catch up to where Bendy was who was almost there laughing a bit before just suddenly tripping on something on the ground and landing face first into the ground which Brook quickly ran up but stopped to go beside him with worry. </p>

<p>“You alright?” Brook asked, which made Bendy look up laughing a bit and smiling while he looked at Brook. “Yeah I’m all good! I’m surprised you aren’t trying to get ahead right now haha!” Bendy answered, which made Brook look back smiling at him as well. “But that won’t make you win against me!” Bendy said quickly getting up ready to start dashing again but suddenly he was hoisted up into the air by one of his legs which made Brook startled seeing Bendy go up quickly checking to see what it was which figured the object Bendy had tripped on was some odd machine that activated to get hold of Bendy by some rope to go into the air, which Bendy struggled to get out from. </p>

<p>“BENDY!” Brook shouted, quickly going over to where Bendy was, stepping closer to where that machine was. “BROOK WAIT! DON’T GET TO CLOSE WHO KNOWS IF HAS EXTRA AND CAN RISK ACTIVATING AGAIN!” Bendy shouted back, which made Brook stop from getting more closer to it but stepped a bit away from it listening in. “Okay, move aside for this, i’m going to try getting free from this here just gotta-” Bendy seemed to then carefully climb up the rope more in a way to reach the part its attached to and tried to push it down but only made the thing wobble and wobble but stayed in place for where it was, which seemed to make Bendy worry on a bit. “Sheesh- uh- Okay this is a lot tougher than I thought.” Bendy spoke up, looking to Brook to see if she was still good from it all. Brook looked to Bendy looking worried then around for anything that could help, there has to be something that could, but before one knew it suddenly heard something quickly swoosh by her and suddenly heard noises of something breaking which when checking can see a bone had hit the machine and caused it to break and malfunction before it loosened the rope which made Bendy quickly get free from and managed to land as a puddle before coming out from that puddle quickly to look as well to it which got him to smile. </p>

<p>“Are you both alright!??” A familiar voice shouted to the two who looked over to hearing it all, which yet felt relieving to hear that. “Mugman! Sans! There you both are! Hah! Guess meeting up here really did work!” Bendy said with a smile while heading over to where one can see Mugman and Sans which Brook came over as well to be part of all of this. “It was the most logical way to go.” Sans added, looking over to Mugman during this. “Well, hey at least we all are back together here and clearly not really hurt, so we all can continue on and find where else that Alovo guy could have gone.” Brook spoke up, looking at everyone while everyone nodded their heads in agreement to that. “A Brilliant plan, fellow people!” Suddenly a new voice shouted at them from afar, someone yet unknown to them. </p>

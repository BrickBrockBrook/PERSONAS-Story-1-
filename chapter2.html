<h2>Chapter 2. A cold world.</h2>

<p>The area, it feels… cold. Where was she? What happened?. Brook seemed to slowly open there eyes fully to see around to figure she is far from home, left alone in this winter forest that felt the area was growing darker. What happened last time? Right, she fell through a portal and ended up here and Sonic… right Sonic isn’t here but back there, fighting all alone, which she is alone to. Not to worry though, right? They both will find one another, maybe he will show, for now, she should continue forward, just alone this time. Brook pulled her cerulean blue hood on some more to handle the cold beginning to walk now once she has gotten her strength to get up, having to walk through the layers of snow that she feels thankful to land in a pile of it or that fall could’ve- oh she doesn’t want to imagine what would happen. </p>

<p>She walked through the place keeping on the faint path one can see through the layers of snow, staying on it and studied the massive dark trees around with no leafs to be found but some had those needles that are similar to the pine trees back home, this universe, it felt like it was home but it’s not, it felt brighter and the feeling there was something in the air, something far different from back home. The air, although it felt cold, was reminding her all of this is real, very real, a way to wake up to say even though it may bother her nose from all that cold air. She continued onward, studying around for something, anything, maybe someone that can help, so she called for help. “Hello?... Anyone here??...” Brook spoke out loud enough hoping someone would hear, which caused a rustle to be heard from a bush somewhere, which made the area grow dead silent. Brook looked over to where she had heard it, studying what it could be but she just saw darkness, inching a bit closer to it as if an attempt to try and see something but remained careful, who knows how dangerous this world could be after all, so she can’t risk being hurt some more. “H-Hello?... Is someone there?...” She spoke out again to find silence, a dead silence, but felt as though one was being watched, watched by something that who knows if it has eyes to say, which felt as though something was wrong.</p>
<h5>Run.</h5>

<p>Is what suddenly echoed through her head, run, that’s what she did then, which right when she began to a roar was heard, turning to look can see a creature that came from the bush calling upon others going after her, which caused a shock of fear to go through her, this is bad, very bad. Brook ran as fast as she could, turning any corners quickly trying to follow the path while she ran, hearing those creatures behind her that take shortcuts to pick up with her pace, they’re getting closer, what is she to do? Till then she shouted “HELP!” as loud as she could even a few times hoping someone will hear, maybe someone will hear, someone ahead or someone from somewhere, hoping someone in this universe will understand and be willing to yet do so. She ran more and more until she took a wrong turn in the path reaching a corner surrounded by trees. This isn’t good, there has to be another way, maybe she can run through the trees? Attempting to do so, she sees creatures deeper within, looking over to where she was and begins to creep towards some going higher up the trees so the idea of climbing won’t work if they're up there. She’s cornered, even looking to see the ones that chased behind her grew closer to, she’s trapped, there isn’t a way out. </p>
She held onto her necklace tightly, attempting to back away from them but her back was against a tree, they were all around her, it’s over. She closed her eyes suspecting the worst to happen, hearing the screams of the creatures screaming loud and lasting a while, till there was silence, was she… dead? “Are you alright?” is what she then suddenly heard, opening her eyes to see she still is where she is, her heart is still beating is what she can feel for it pounding in her chest from fear, which she looked over to where she heard the voice to see a black and white toon before her, except with a small bit of red on their cheek as if injured there that creates a injury looking like a lightning bolt, looking as though like a demon, an old cartoon demon with a white bow tie and gloves and black boots. “Wh- what happened?” Brook spoke up, looking at the toon then around, able to see another appearing as a skeleton who wore a blue hood and black shorts with pink slippers, except one can see a tear in the sleeves of their hood. 

<p>“Well we heard someone screaming and came to help! Since can’t leave anyone in danger, even for someone who could’ve been really hurt” Seemed the toon responded with a small smile, saved by these beings of sorts, well, guess it’s a way to pay back for her helping another being. “Oh- well, thank you, both of you…” Brook responded to it giving a small smile, surely thankful of them both for doing such a thing. “Alright, enough talk you two, come on can take her to somewhere safe and get back to helping others in danger” the skeleton seemed to then speak up, beginning to guide the way to there which the toon reacted to quickly, which looked over at Brook, offering a hand to help them up, which Brook quietly looked at it and accepted it, being brought up before the toon began to quickly chase after the skeleton, shouting “WAIT UP!” which Brook began to follow. Once both the toon and Brook were near, Brook just quietly followed behind while seeing the two beings walk together, seeming to chat which Brook listened in on. </p>

<p>“DON’T JUST WALK AWAY LIKE THAT! SHEESH! COULD’VE PUT HER IN DANGER!” The toon seemed to yell a bit, looking at the skeleton. “She would’ve been fine since you were there to help.” The skeleton responded with a bit of attitude as if seeming quite annoyed currently probably because of this whole situation that is going on. “THAT STILL WASN’T A GOOD IDEA! You know I don’t have powers like you do, mister it ain’t easy even for helping your universe!” the toon responded which watched the skeleton just seemed to not dare argue back focused on leading the way there, which caused a silence to happen even a mumbled sorry coming from one of them during it, soon they reached what seems like a town but currently it’s in quite the condition, being attacked and destroyed by many of the creatures seeing portals open all around it and others running to spots to hide at, which can tell by the two beings faces this was not how it looked before, causing the skeleton leading the way to the one place quickly which the toon showed the way making sure Brook followed along. They all dashed to what seemed to be a restaurant of some kind, running in and closing the door shut once the three were in, which currently seems nobody else is in there but them three, to guess everyone else must be hiding elsewhere somewhere in this town.</p>

<p>“Alright, you two wait here, I will check the back for any supplies to see if there can be enough for others, which will check if any are hiding in the back along with it, wait here.” The skeleton spoke, which the toon didn’t suspect, causing them to talk back seeing the skeleton walk away during when he did “You’re just going to leave them here in a disastrous world outside!?? HEY! DON’T WALK AWAY- SANS-” the toon seemed to then sigh seeing the skeleton was gone that was learned to be named Sans, which the toon seemed to find a spot to sit at in the restaurant, sitting there surely annoyed but thinking. Brook was silent surely, not suspecting all of this to happen, surely was a lot to say, to think though, for how it seems both them could be quite good at fighting and wanting to stop this it seems too, maybe she can ask them to help? But then again she isn’t sure. She took a moment finding a spot to sit at, which to think may take some time for what could happen or not, so she got out her small little drawing book she uses for traveling in her pocket and got a pencil as well, beginning to draw a bit, quite a nice way to clear her mind simply even for a situation such as this, just studying her surroundings drawing what she saw till looked over at the toon, thinking then began to draw them even for the pose there in quietly, which was pretty simple to do for after all she has drawn toons of sorts before, to say she never suspected to meet one but to guess anything could be possible, right?</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Seemed to suddenly hear that looking up from her drawing book to see the toon had gotten up and went over standing right in front of them, able to see a look of curiosity on the toon's face. “I’m… drawing?” Brook seemed to give a confused look, holding up the drawing book a bit to show them it, nervous a bit what this toon may think of her drawings, which the toon seemed to sit beside now to look at the drawings they made by her side, seeming curious of each one, then smiles at her. “Wow! These are amazing! I love the detail you put into it! Got to say lady you got quite a talent!” hearing the toon say that caused a smile to appear on Brook’s face, quite nice to hear positive feedback to something such as this. “Thank you, it’s something I quite enjoy doing” Brook spoke up, looking at the toon, till saw the toon turn to fully face Brook from where they sat, offering their hand out for a handshake. “Well, I’m Bendy, what’s your name?” The toon now known as Bendy smiled at Brook, which Brook took a moment to then accept the handshake, both shaking hands with one another before letting go. “I’m Brook, I came from another universe aside from here.” “Well is that so? I did too! Except I got stuck in this one but I am not complaining, it’s so colorful here versus the one I am from!” Bendy responded with a smile hearing that, he seems quite glad to be able to chat with Brook, quite a wonder why to say. </p>

<p>“Well, it is nice you’re enjoying it in some sense. Again thank you for well, complimenting my art” “Well how couldn’t I? Artists gotta compliment other artists' work even if from other universes!” Bendy responded with a smile, which caused Brook to get curious about such a thing like that now. “Really? You do too? Well that is very cool! Who knew this kind of thing exists in other universes?” “Yeah! Quite the surprise if you ask me! Even if well- universes are being attacked what seems like everywhere… which is not good that is happening at all for many are losing places that they may call home! Honestly if I had the power, I would want to stop this all and maybe even stay at one the ones that could exist out there!” Bendy seemed to respond, looking over to the window, seeing creatures roam around destroying and tearing apart things, which Brook looked over to Bendy hearing that, someone who wants to stop this too? Well, to say this could be something good, something that can help to say, help them stop this, they both could even with their friend if they can and if they find Sonic they can all stop this! </p>

<p>“Hey, I want to stop this all too actually, maybe well, you can come along and help out! I agreed to do this with another but we got separated due to the portals opening around, but we can find them and stop this together! Maybe your friend can come along too?” Once Brook said that, Bendy looked over not suspecting it but a smile grew on there face, standing right up from his chair throwing his arms in the air shouting “YES! YES THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! You know I think we were destined to meet for something like this! Great! Alright, the thing is though I am not sure how we can convince Sans since he could be a big help, but he always tells me to back off…” Can tell this caused Bendy to start thinking, which Brook began to as well, quite something to think about, till Brook thought of something quickly. “Well, Can say if he does come along it can help stop his universe from being in danger here, even make some friends along the way because of it, then he can relax for as long as he needs after that!” Once Brook said that can tell Bendy looked over with a smile hearing that, surely he hasn’t thought of that. “That’s a good idea! Much better than the one I thought for being redeemed a hero for it and all” “Well, there we go! The three of us as a team! And maybe hopefully a fourth soon if we find him, but we can manage the three of us!” Brook responded with a smile while Bendy smiled back, a plan has been made truly, a plan of sorts to first try and convince the other but a plan to in some way stop this and that so far is a start of a team of some sort, maybe they all could become friends cause of this, which surely may happen if they’re all working together. </p>

<p>“Alright! So for now while we wait… Dare you to draw me!” Bendy seemed to yell in excitement while he got up, quickly checking behind the counter that wasn’t far and finding a cowboy hat, putting it on and posing which caused Brook to laugh a bit at this before beginning to draw. This was pretty fun to her, to think a start to a friendship that they both seem to get along even for art in some way, hopefully however the other is could be easy to bond with as well like how she is with Bendy right now. She continued to draw before taking a moment to check for if she did it right, checking how Bendy was posing and then went over and showed it to Bendy with a smile, “Is this good?” Brook spoke up, watching Bendy get hold of the small drawing book to get a better look at it all and smiles up at them. “Perfect! Looks just like it but with your own creative flare! Hey! How about I try one with you?” Bendy offered while he took the hat off and offered it to Brook if she wanted to use it too. “Sure! Can be fun to see your style too!” Brook responded with a smile, getting hold of the hat while handing the pencil as got into position, watching Bendy step back and study for a moment everything he could see before drawing, often glancing up to see if he was getting it all right.</p>

<p>This was now like a game of waiting to see how the results were going to turn out, how long will it take? Who knows but yet this was quite fun, which often when Bendy glanced up he smiled at her while she just smiled back some more remaining in pose for it, waiting until Bendy seemed to smile more looking at the book before going over and showing it being able to tell he was proud of it. “Whatcha think?? Did I capture it all just right?” Bendy spoke up while Brook got hold of the book and studied it, seeing how vs her own style his was more detailed and near an realistic approach but has like a cartoon like feeling to it, able to see how they figured how to do the correct posing and lighting even the shading. Brook smiled looking up at Bendy from this, which can tell when Bendy saw it got more excited to hear what she thought. “It looks wonderful, Bendy! Really captured all the details in it all!” Once Brook said that, Bendy threw his arms in the air in such excitement from hearing that while shouted “YES! AWESOME!” Quite loudly, laughing a bit before settling down, smiling at Brook once he has with quite a big smile showing they really are happy. “Oh that’s great to hear! Gotta say hearing you say that makes it like all the more of a good feeling of some kind! Almost like it’s magic from a- actually I don’t know what creature thing you are” Seemed to then study Brook, can tell Bendy was trying to figure what she was, like he hasn’t seen a human before at all, which is different even for herself to have happen. <em>Is she really human?</em> </p> 

<p>“Well I am human! Which is like this- a person who has sk-” “WAIT YOUR HUMAN? Oh this is so different from how I imagined them looking! Hah! The first human I ever met is someone who loves art just like me! So what can you humans do? Like what powers do you have??” Can tell when Brook said she was caused Bendy to be excited, already asking a question that yet there could be more to come for questions as well, surely unsuspected for her to think he will know what a human is, well at least in some way that is. “Well no, no we don’t, none at all. Which is unfortunate even for a situation like this that is going on.” “Darn! So I was wrong about that then, Which now with you saying that would be quite a situation for you even in this universe for what I learned everything has magic here except the creatures roaming around. Hey though not to worry! You got me and hopefully Sans, if we can convince him, we can protect you while you can lead the way to what could help us figure out what could be causing this load of madness and chaos!” Bendy responded once learnt Brook doesn’t have any powers of sorts, but yet found a way to reassure them anyhow and it isn’t going to make it be some way that stops this, showing he sees Brook could be capable of this power or not.</p>

<p>“Thank you, surely means a lot you’re willing to do that” Brook smiled which caused Bendy to smile back, which then can hear a door nearby open from where they are, causing both them to look over quickly to see it was that skeleton what Bendy called Sans, seeming to fix his hood and look over at them before his focus went to Brook. “They’re is enough food for you and any others that we bring back for you to have in the back, just don’t take it all for yourself.” Once Sans spoke up can tell Bendy gave a look at Sans as if he doesn’t like the idea to leave Brook here, in fact can guess he must be thinking of Brooks' idea over Sans’s. “NOW HANG ON! Why leave her here!? There is clearly danger outside and she is just a human with no powers here! In fact I believe she has a better idea other than this!” Once Bendy said that he looked over to Brook, giving a small smile as a way to reassure her so she knows it’s okay to speak for he would be here to help if anything goes wrong, which Brook took a moment before speaking up looking at Sans during it. </p>

<p>“Well, For what I have thought about is since you both have powers versus me and both want this to stop it seems, I thought what if we all work together to find what is causing it, I can lead the way for what I think would be causing anything while if there is a threat you guys could take care of it, which although that may seem like I am using you when I’m not trying to but just want to help stop this all.” Once Brook said that, Sans was silent, looking over at Bendy as if suspecting if he would say something to this as well, perhaps to get a better idea on all of this. “With an offer like that I say it could help us! I find a new home in one of the universes, you get to be- what lazy again? unless you’re searching for something too! Come on, for what I can tell from Brook here won’t dare do anything bad, It’s like I can sense she is all good, like a light of some kind, like for example a lightbulb! So come on Sans!” Bendy went over to where Sans is trying to convince as well to help Brook out with it. </p>

<p>Can tell Sans was just listening to it all, all surely something that is quite a bit for him to hear from these two, taking a moment to think now, till sighed, speaking up now to the two. “Alright, fine, I will join you both. Could be better than trying to keep everyone in hiding from the things going on outside.” Bendy once he heard Sans say it threw his arms in the air again in celebration while shouting a “WOO! YES WE GOT A TEAM HERE!”, which Brook watched laughing a bit at it. Sans seemed to then come over to Brook, taking a moment before offering his hand out to them, seeming to be a white gloved hand that looks like a mitten versus the one Bendy has, till Sans spoke up during when he did. “Well, Names Sans, Sans the Skeleton.” Brook took a moment, studying it a bit before shaking his hand, responding to them. “I’m Brook, happy to properly meet you too Sans.” </p>

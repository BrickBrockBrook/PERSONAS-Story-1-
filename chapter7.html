<h2>Chapter 7. Fight or Flight</h2>

<p>She got thrown right into one the trees nearby, hitting into it knocking the snow off that comforted her fall to the ground, surely quite covered in some injuries some being cuts that bleed or bruises from the trees around or by the impact of a kick or punch but she is yet still trying her best to fight back despite it, looking to Balaur who had opened his wings wide to prevent escape while they came over walking with a huge grin on his face, a grin that hinted something terrible is being plotted. She got up again quickly, but fell because her legs felt weak from all of this fighting. She needed to fight though, making her wish she had powers just so she won’t have to rely so much on others for help. “Oh you poor little jewel, you cannot even have the ability to stand up, now how does that make you a hero if you can’t even stand up for yourself? Not even for others you could very well be trying to save!” Balaur spoke, going over to where Brook is and standing above them, then kneeled down to be at her level, but still had a large grin. “Let’s face it you’re no hero but a little girl thinking she has all the power to do this with her kind nature and believes in having a godly power, when there isn’t any.” Balaur moved closer, putting his hand against the tree Brook stood up behind, making her surely uncomfortable by this, she had to think fast. </p>

<h5>Up</h5>

<p>She felt the need to look up, making her look a bit up seeing a pile of snow on a branch above right to where Balaur was, making her get an idea quickly on a way to see if it can be knocked down. “As often I won’t say this, I got something for you. Shove up this idea of yours on me up your ass.” “Oh you’re really asking for it aren’t you? I’m guessing you’re trying to plot something just to get me to go with to have it succeed then the sudden plan. How cute.” Balaur responded to what Brook said, well that isn’t good, time to try and improvise then. She quickly raised her arm to try and hit the tree but Balaur got hold of her by the wrist and squeezed to hold it there which hurt, what to do now if he is gonna have an improvise for each move? Then heard the branch breaking from above, causing both her and Balaur to look up and see a odd COTS got onto it and it broke off from the weight, giving Brook a chance to break free for Balaur being distracted and to roll away before the branch hit Balaur quickly and the odd COTS on it tumbled and rolled into the snow but it was piled for where they landed, which Brook studied it as the COTS looked back, it looked just like the one she saw before when sneaking past all those COTS from before, which was odd how it stayed for a moment before it ran off perhaps to escape from this battle that yet goes on. </p>

<p>Brook then quickly turned to look, seeing Balaur push the branch off him and the snow that cleared gave him a chill, making Brook have to think fast, she has to do something, it’s either fight or flight here, unless she can improvise some other plan for an option of sorts. “What a lucky girl you must be for that huh? But looks like luck will have to end here though.” Balaur spoke up, getting the snow off him, watching it give him a chill, giving her an idea to quickly try to make a snowball in the snow but it wasn’t forming right or working for the snow was too soft, she had to improvise. She quickly looked and saw the trees around, she could climb them, despite her not often doing so even with these trees she could try, so she began to run right to the nearest tree, but she heard Balaur from behind her notice and began to charge quickly to go after her. She quickly got hold of the first lowest branch then another near to pull herself up putting her feet against the base of the tree to get herself onto the first branch just dodging Balaurs charge attack hitting his hand into the tree that shook it from the impact but then he looked up to Brook but began to grin there wings beginning to open, that’s not good. She quickly got hold of the one above and pulled herself up onto it, then the next that was a easy step up to it then a climb for the next, so far she is doing good with the climbing, even at a good pace to get away from where Balaur was being far d- wait Balaur isn’t down there anymore, where did he go? She checked around quickly and then felt the top the tree shake, looking to see Balaur had flew up to the top of it and was grinning down to look at Brook who was in the middle section for the way up making her feel stupid to think this will help her get away from a guy with wings for crying out loud. </p>

<p>“Oh how clever to try and do, but yet you’re dealing a target that can fly dear so don’t suspect a tree to be there to save you all the time, or suspect anyone else wi-'' mid sentence of Balaur’s speech he then had a rocky hit right into his face at a strong and quick speed to knock him off but he caught himself and landed on a branch of another tree, making Brook quickly have the chance to rush down to try and go for maybe a farther tree, reaching the bottom but then stopped to see who was here, but couldn’t see anyone so leaves the wonder who threw the rock. “WANT SOME MORE YEAH SCRAWNY BIRD!??” A familiar voice shouted from near behind where she was, making her turn to look to see Bendy who shouted at where Balaur was, then looked to where Brook was seeming to know she was there, studying her for a moment then looked worried at her, which makes sense to her at least for she is covered in injuries clearly. “Brook what happened to you!? What did that guy do?” “I’m okay Bendy, it’s just some injur-'' Brook was explaining till quickly Bendy grabbed her by both her arms to pull her aside quickly to dodge an attack being thrown right at her before quickly kicking up a rock with his foot and kicking it right to Balaur quickly but yet he dodges it and charges to them for another attack. </p>

<p>Bendy quickly pulled Brook along to move aside from it, then let go of her, looking at her for a moment while prepared to attack Balaur, surely able to tell he was serious. “Stay close, Find what you can around here like rocks or sticks and throw it at him, I suggest going for the eyes or in between them! For that must be a weak spot for all dragons right?” Bendy kinda asked with a follow up question when he explained what Brook can try to do, as he then quickly turned to where Balaur was, seeing he was gone, then looked around which caused Brook to look up, seeing Balaur dive down hands outstretched ready to either grab hold of one of them or to claw at them, making Brook quickly move her hand onto his back for a moment to push him down to the ground as she went down herself, causing both to be nearly face first into the snow dodging the attack quickly. “Quick thinking as always Brook-” “Thanks- wait where is Sans?? Did that large COTS get him??” Brook asked quickly, looking at Bendy while sat up, when Bendy was, noticed Balaur about to try again that attack, making Bendy shove Brook back down while he went down to. </p>

<p>“He is fighting it with DDraig! Yeah, I found the guy by chance who wanted to help while giving me the chance to come and help you cause look at you, you're hurt!” “But i’m alright though, still alive even if it hurts but I can keep going so you-” “OH DON’T GIVE ME THAT! YOU’RE NOT DOING THIS ALONE! Surely I’m going to seriously start making sure you know that at this point and will for decades if I have to!” Bendy argued right back to Brook trying to say otherwise, which was something she surely was not suspecting but it made her know though someone was here for her which felt nice, then laughter interrupted the two, making both of them quickly look and sit up ready to fight. “Oh I never seen anything like this, Which yet gave me time to steal this from your yapping” Balaur said, standing in front of where they are holding up the necklace Brook was wearing, causing a worry for both of them quickly. Bendy then seemed to get up quickly in anger charging at Balaur while shouting “GIVE THAT BACK!” But Balaur flew up to dodge but Bendy got a hold at the end of his tail using the strength he had to try and pull Balaur down which was keeping Balaur from flying. Brook then quickly rushed over, studying to see what she can do before then quickly found a way to pull herself up onto Bendy’s shoulders and which Bendy stayed still to let Brook get on as was able to reach Balaur better to try and steal the necklace back but Balaur was trying to kick Brook away or scratch them, some way of hitting but each time he tried Bendy used more of the strength he can to try and pull Balaur down to throw him off, giving Brook an opening when Bendy did again to take the necklace getting it on again that caused Bendy to let go. Balaur then once let free grinned and quickly got hold of Brook by the sleeve of her hood to quickly then fly up making her quickly hold on to not fall being flown up high now stuck in the air with Balaur holding onto it and grinning, surely a situation to be stuck in. </p>

<p>“Oh what is the little gem going to do with her Light knight being all the way down there? And what will he do if this gem falls all the way down to her death then?” Balaur grinned more, readying to let go of Brook but Brook held on in a struggle to try and survive all the way up in this sky that yet shows it was more like a magical cave of sorts for there being no real sky. What is there she can do? Does she leave it to fate to decide if she will fall into the darkness or will she still see all the life that is around? If it’s kept her alive this far, why wouldn’t it now to think, Trust the fall. Then that's when a bone hit Balaur, then another, and another, multiple that caused Balaur to try and fight it off before quickly dropping Brook forcing her to let go to try and fight back against the bones going after, Thus she began to fall, falling felt quite quick, this could be very well bad, she was thrown further then where she was before for the fighting ground, what is there she can do? To think the outcome could very well be death, but, other plans must’ve been in mind for her. </p>

<p>She landed into a large pile of snow in a spot somewhere in the forest that cushioned the fall that she sinked quite a bit into it but enough to not drown her being quite lucky for it to be this sort of snow to think, taking a moment for her to take a moment to figure what's happened, she nearly died once again but yet was saved by this snow pile that yet wasn’t a hard snow or too soft where she could’ve hit the ground, which forget about that now, for she was alive just only some injury to it but she was yet still alive. She took a moment and just kinda relaxed there, so much is going on she needs a moment to take a breather here and the snow felt comfy like a nice warm blanket to warm here during a cold day and to make it all relaxing, she knows she will be found anyways. After a moment she can hear a familiar voice yelling “BROOK!” going near to where the direction is, which she heard and took a moment to sit up once she heard it slowly, then saw Bendy come through the trees and once saw Brook who was looking back he sighed in relief, going to where the pile is and speaking up again, “Oh what are the chances of this luck? Thank inky god you are okay!” Bendy came over, getting up onto the pile, which Brook gave a small smile to show she still is alright, she surely is lucky to have survived that.  </p>

<p>“Yeah, I think I could use a little help getting up though..” Brook said, looking at the snow around her that she was stuck in before seeing Bendy offer his hand to which she got her arm out to accept it, being pulled right up from out of it having to shake the rest of the snow off. “Got to say that’s such a miracle, now do you need help with these injuries?? I have a way I can which i’m not sure how would it work for you since I don’t know if humans got ink or-” “No, No Bendy it’s okay, plus I doubt it’ll work since i’m made of  blood not ink, come on, we got to go back and help Sans to stop this guy” Brook responded, which Bendy only studied her hearing that, then sighed a bit, looking to the direction to where the battle was, beginning to lead the way back quickly while saying “Alright then, come on!” which Brook began to follow quickly not wanting to be left behind. They both quickly rushed through the trees Bendy seeming to know where the direction was making it right to there in no time and which Brook did but stopped behind him due to him blocking the way seeing an attack of fire burst right in front of them before vanishing seeing bones fly out after to go after the cause of it, seeing Sans stand in the center of the area trying to summon as many bones or blasters as quick as he could to fight them off and which Balaur continued to dodge quite a bit of it and tries flying down to breath fire onto Sans in which he manages to just dodge each time, surely seems he could use help clearly. Making Brook and Bendy quickly rush in to help, Bendy quickly going ahead and jumping up to throw a punch when Balaur swooped down but Balaur dodged it hitting Bendy away with his tail when going by, then began to fly down charging to where Brook was, making Brook stumble for a moment before Sans quickly jumped in front of her summoning a blaster in front of him to block off the attack trying to keep Balaur back who hit into it but yet flew up and began to start shooting out fire right out to attempt destroying it. </p>

<p>Which caused Bendy to notice quickly, rushing over to go there but yet when jumping to try and reach Balaurs tail to throw them away Balaur moved higher that made him shoot more flames hitting him away quickly, making Bendy tumble back, thinking of what way to reach, making Brook study for how Sans kept holding Balaur back, trying to think up a plan quickly to managed to figure one out, going to Sans whispering a plan she had, “Could you block my way so I can reach Bendy?” “I can try, Do you have some plan or something?” Sans asked continuing to keep Balaur back with the blaster which Brook nodded giving Sans the message, before quickly running her way to there while Sans summoned bones as a way to block off any attacks that could go at Brook which seems it was yet attempted for Balaur noticed quickly and tried to redirect the flames to there, but Sans began to try and use the blaster to blast at Balaur to make him redirect his focus to use his fire to force the blast back from hitting him. Then Brook quickly got to where Bendy was who was going to jump again, making her go to him and whisper a bit in a way to be sure Balaur won't here what she has in mind, “Bendy, I got an idea how you can reach him, but you’re going to have to use me as a boost up” “Well if you think it’ll work Brook, Let’s do it!” quickly, Brook then stepped in front of him then moved closer to the ground so Bendy can jump right onto her back which he did. </p>

<p>He took a moment to aim before Brook carefully stood a bit as letting Bendy take the chance to move in a way to get up onto her shoulders so that way he can be more closer, managing to stay standing with him on her shoulders, then looked a bit to Bendy who managed to get his balance right before taking aim for where Balaur was, then jumped up high reaching for Balaurs tail and got hold of it, causing Balaur to be startled by it trying to swing his tail around to get Bendy off. Sans then once saw it stopped his blaster from shooting so won’t hurt Bendy which gave Balaur a chance to try and use his flames on Bendy but Bendy began to swing to throw his aim off in quite a struggle in some way but was working. Quickly Sans summoned a bone into his hand and made a bone staircase up to where they are, going up it quickly readying the bone but seems Balaur was able to react fast for once Sans was close he used the strength he can to spin and hit Sans off with his tail that Bendy hung onto tight that made him accidentally hit into Sans and nearly let go. Brook quickly rush to where he was going to land and went to try and pile some snow but knows there won't be enough time to but seeing it’s by a tree that had a lot of snow on it, she quickly tackled the tree to shake it and knock all the snow down making a larger pile in no time from all the branches that was piled with it that lucky Sans landed right into just on time being saved from the fall because of that snow pile. </p>

<p>“Are you alright??” “Yeah, Yeah, just tired from this fighting. Don’t see why we got to do this though Brook.” Sans mentioned taking a moment to breathe while laying in the snow before sitting up, seeing how Bendy still held on tight and Balaur began to spin fast to try and throw him off but he was handling it quite well it does seem. “I’m sorry this is going on… But this guy is going to prevent us as much as possible from going forward and finding answers. Look, take a moment to rest while I can try doing what you did there, okay?” Brook explained and even asked which Sans was not suspecting, but he took a moment before summoning that bone again that vanished cause of the fall and handed it to Brook who wasn’t sure if it would hurt her but once she touched it she was yet fine, then the area felt it flickered for a moment before going into this black and white coloration all around as if this was the effects of touching his attack, to see what he sees when fighting. “Watch each move Brook.” Sans said while he was taking a moment to regain his energy otherwise who knows if he can cast even more magic, which Brook gave a nod to that, turning to where Balaur was spinning Bendy around and around while Bendy held on, seeing there black and white as well and how the surroundings looked more like a grid with a box around to block off running out from the area, this could be worked with. </p>

<p>She checks seeing the bone in hand that looked like it was pixelated a bit which was interesting, like it was a video game of sorts, then looked to see bones appear in front of her being as well pixelated, so the attacks must be pixelated to think, seeing then Balaur about to throw some flames at Bendy who held on and kept swaying around right when the flames shot out being pixelated except orange that seemed it was hitting but Bendy wasn’t hurt, so there's different kinds to figure from this too. Quickly she began to try and go up the bones quickly being like a staircase which lucky she often has run up stairs before when younger, running right up seeing Balaurs back is turned and Bendy does seem tired out from it seeing Balaur preparing to throw even more flames until Brook was right there. She began taking aim, seeing a box appear in front with a bar going across as it seemed it tells the strength or when to hit so she then took focus then swung fast the bar landing right in the center of what it showed in the box before disappearing and hitting Balaur right in the back, clashing his wings together able to see numbers appear being quite the high amount of numbers as if she dealt a heavy amount of damage, seeing things begin to flicker back while the attacks were flickering as well as if about to disappear till they have and the world shifted right back to normal, seeing Balaur hit right into the ground rolling in the snow with Bendy letting go and landing on the ground becoming a puddle and popping out making the fall not hurt as she began to fall as well but the fall didn’t last long being caught right in the air by the one blaster Sans summoned bringing her right down carefully before it disappeared and she landed into the snow. </p>

<p>“Brook! Are you okay??” “I’m alright, I’m alright… Did we get him?” Brook asked, managing to get up carefully with Bendy coming over, giving a small helping hand to help her up, getting her balance first before she was able to stand on her own. “Huh, not bad Brook, you handled using that magic quite well.” Sans said, coming over to the two which made Brook and Bendy look, Brook giving a smile but it seemed Bendy had an even wider smile to it. “SHE WAS AMAZING ARE YOU KIDDING?? As that was clever of you to do Sans! Got her to really understand the feeling of it, I think we would’ve never done it without you!” Bendy explained, going over to Sans putting an arm around in a friendly manner to show he his happy, which Sans seemed to not really suspect but he seemed to enjoy hearing that from someone in some way, even got him to have a more relaxed look versus the one that seemed more bothered by something which was nice to see. Then the three heard coughing, all looking to where it was being Balaur who was in the snow but slowly sitting up, coughing and seeming quite hurt even for the back for how his wings covered up that spot, which caused Bendy to quickly step in front of the two to protect them as the other two prepared for if this was going to be another fight of some kind. “Oh you proved me wrong now, all of you, even you little íroesite girl, but yet you couldn’t do it alone so it makes me wonder what happens if you were stuck alone without anyone being able to find you… Oh you will surely see me again little hero stone girl, even in the dark.” Balaur said, looking to where Brook was, grinning in such a creepy way but weakly too as he began to stand, making Bendy step more in front of Brook right away to protect her, while Sans prepared for if there was any danger. Then a portal opened right behind Balaur, Balaur looking at the three still with that grin as he stepped back to go right through it looking at them all as Bendy seemed to react fast, trying to go after it while shouting “WAIT! COME BACK YOU LITTLE-” But Balaur was gone before they knew it and the portal closed right when Bendy tried to enter it, nearly hitting into a tree when doing so. He was gone, now the three may have to start right back at square one to try and find this guy or have a hint to them, now they have to rethink what to do.</p>

<p>“WELL GREAT! WE LOST THE GUY THAT CAN HELP US FIND ANSWERS! NOW WHAT DO WE DO??” “There should be a way to improvise like going to DDraig for he seems to know stuff on it.” Sans gave in some way an answer which Bendy looked to him giving a look that seemed well he still was concerned about it but was interested in the idea. “Yeah that can work BUT THAT MEANS WE WOULD’VE NEVER HAD TO GO AFTER THAT GUY WHO HAS ESCAPED WITH A PORTAL! LIKE COME ON WHAT'S WITH THESE PORTA-” during when Bendy was saying that, suddenly a portal appeared right in front of him when he was walking towards falling right into it with a startled scream, making Brook and Sans rush over to it, seeing Bendy fall down to an unknown world that was hard to figure what was there. In a quick moment, Brook looked at the portal then quickly without a thought jumped right into it to go after him, hearing Sans who was startled and in a moment heard Sans hop right in from behind, hearing the portal close while they began to fall while now in another universe that was all so unfamiliar to the three, unknown if they will die or live on to see if they can stop this portal madness.</p>

<h5>The heroes press on minute by minute</h5>
<h5>Not even a moment of hesitation from any of them,</h5>
<h5>At least for now that’s the case…</h5>

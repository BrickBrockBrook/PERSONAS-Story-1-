<h2>Chapter 3. Dragons Clues</h2>

<p>Snow, it’s everywhere the three walked, everywhere one looked, seeing it all on the ground covering bushes and the pine trees around, everywhere, while it seemed to begin snowing a bit as for the spot the three are at is currently safe for how bright it feels, light, something that she finds herself to be a way of safety, a safe spot. The air may have felt a bit chilly to her but she was lucky to be wearing at least some appropriate clothes for it aside from another jacket or a hat even, but yet it reminds her it’s all real, everything is, it’s all alive, and aside from first being here all alone, she has two others, one a toon she learnt a bit of quite quickly going by Bendy who loves art like she does and Sans who she may still be learning but seems when Bendy chats with Sans he seems closed off or annoyed for what she can study, probably there is a reason to it, maybe he isn’t that person both her and Bendy are seeing. </p>

<p>During this walk, mostly Bendy was trying to chat with Sans and Sans mostly gave a somewhat response which Bendy tried to get him talking but no luck, till then Bendy kind of moved now to walk by Brooks side, which made her look over and see Bendy smile at Brook once she did. “So, what’s it like in your universe anyways? Is it like this one?” Bendy seemed to speak up, causing Brook to think for a way to explain it before responding, “Not exactly but I find it a bit similar, it’s more brighter here and more a magic feel here versus mine, it’s kind of dull some days and nothing to special but there is quite some nature around but not as much nature like here for what I’m seeing, mostly buildings quite around and houses. Doesn’t have much of anything special if you ask me versus well what’s being discovered right now.” Once Brook did respond she was able to notice Bendy seemed all so curious even though she said it’s nothing too special, like he really wants to know all sorts about it. </p>

<p>“Your world sounds cool! Well may not be though like the one we are at but it sounds so cool versus how mine does which is much much worse if you ask me, it’s… Well that isn’t a worry won’t be going back there no no! Going to say in one of these universes, maybe one that is like what you said but better! Brighter and more life and nature and has that magic feeling! Imagine a universe like that! Hey, maybe you may like it too since it could remind you of home but it’s much more colorful!” Bendy smiled, surely finding it cool and better than however his is like, quite the wonder how his is like but for how he seemed to say it’s worse than what she said, feels as though to her it’s good he is out from it anyways. “Let’s hope there is a universe like that out there, a universe like that sounds well near perfect depending on how the rest there are like!” Brook spoke up, which caused Bendy to think and when he was gonna respond, Sans spoke up over him. “Both of you should quiet down here, those creatures could be around the forest here and if they find out we are here they will attack. Whatever these beings are, they all surely don’t stop at nothing.” “OH COME ON! You're strong with your bone magic and weird bone beings that blast, we will be fine! Besides for the way we are going to figure out about that portal from where Brook came from to see if it could be a key to things, no danger can get us out here!” Bendy quite somewhat complained back, proving there shouldn’t be any threats out here at all, which Sans sighed. </p>

<p>“Well more keep coming after some get handled with, causing more and more armies of them, which if anything they target Brook for what we learnt, so surely they may stop at nothing to go after her and the rest of us.” “Okay, Okay fair- Which is a wonder why they do target her- Brook do you got some kind of thing you ain’t telling us?” Bendy looked over at Brook which made Brook give a confused look back, hide anything? No! She wouldn’t do that, even if some responses to it are negative she dares to not hide anything, not even to these two. “I’m not hiding anything! I am not sure either why they all are but they all just keep targeting me. I wish I knew then I would’ve told you both in the first place.” She watched as Bendy seemed to nod in understanding now to this all, surely it seems Bendy believes Brook but Sans seems unsure, gives the idea Sans doesn’t gain trust all that easily for what she can study from him. “How do we know you aren’t lying?” “HEY SHE AIN’T LYING! I SEEN LYING THAT AIN’T LYING! She is as confused as we are, if anything she seems too good for such a thing!” Bendy snapped right back at Sans for saying that, quite like he is defending Brook from this so she doesn’t have to struggle with this alone. Sans didn’t say anything back, keeping his mouth shut for this like he hasn’t literally had it shut already with his teeth that he someone can speak without opening his mouth quite clearly, continuing to walk going ahead to where abouts he believed the spot to be at for must’ve been described before to him and yet he is the most familiar with this forest anyways, which caused Bendy to try and hurry up right away running up to catch up which caused Brook to do so as well. </p>

<p>Maybe there is an answer to it, maybe there isn’t, she isn’t sure herself, hopefully there is one, so it won’t be all so confusing for why it all is happening all of this. While she walked she just kind of got hold of the stone that’s on the necklace she wore and studied it, finding it looked a bit more brighter here of a color versus back home, making it yet stand out more for its blue colors. “Where did you get that?” Brook looked up to see Bendy looking as well walking by Brook’s side, which Brook gave a small smile at hearing that question. “Oh it was something I kind of found that my mom let me keep, caught my eye ever since I saw it really and I’m not sure why it has.” “Well, It looks very nice! Quite a wonder why it caught your eyes but could because it’s a very nice blue! Really matches with what you are wearing! Blue- haha sheesh can’t believe despite hearing the word I never suspected to see the color of it for how it’s said to have color” Bendy smiled, then looked around to look at each and every color this place has, currently for where they are it is quite such a blue like place that may have a few darker turquoise like colors from the pine trees around with some dark brown of the trees to make the blue look more bright for everything. “Do you not have color in your universe kind of like those movies in black and white?” </p>

<p>“Well for me it’s just black and yellow, boring colors and the yellow isn’t really a good yellow in fact it’s like it’s orange if anything! So to say black and orange! Which would’ve been y'know cool instead it was blue and orange cause it’s said the colors go together” Bendy replied to what Brook said, causing her to nod and look around but focus to where Sans is, noticing Sans seeming to have looked over a bit but then looked away once one looked as if figured he was listening, thinking about it and decided to speak up now, best to also try and befriend Sans more too or at least make sure he is alright and not left out. “Sooo Sans, is there anything about your universe as well that we are in?” Once Brook did ask, Sans did look a bit over, then looked ahead focusing on walking as if focused on wanting to stop all this truly. “Nothing much really, except down here it’s an underground full of monsters while humans live outside of here.” “WAIT YOU KNOW WHAT HUMANS ARE!??” Bendy seemed to then shout out as he seemed to not know this till now, but yet can explain why Sans didn’t really ask what Brook is of sorts versus Bendy who did. </p>

<p>“You got humans in this universe too?” “Yeah, they’re just outside of here, sometimes one falls into the underground having to try and escape. There have been many humans over the years that have fallen down here, some I got to know myself.” Sans explained, which does make sense, but can tell that gave Bendy more questions versus Brook who didn’t really get any other questions to think of and ask. “Were you friends with one then?? That would be so cool if anything! Hey, maybe we can meet them!” Once Bendy said that Sans just fell silent and continued walking, not answering the question. Brook and Bendy looked at one another once that happened still falling with both probably thinking the same thing, and it’s a worry for if he is okay or if something was wrong, or maybe it was worse than that for all they both know. Till suddenly while they all walked silent at this moment, A loud scream was heard that yet sounded like a startled one, as for one can think that could mean one that can start to lead to more for a chase of sorts, which caused Brook to start to try and quickly go that direction to where she heard it before the other two, causing the other two to quickly follow behind to figure out where the noise was, who could be in danger, what could be in danger, rather it’s human or not, they must help them, they got to. <em>She can help them.</em></p>

<p>They all ran towards the sound, Brook taking the lead going to where she heard it trying to figure what she could with her knowledge of figuring where it’s from, trying to figure it out quickly for someone could be in danger.</p>

<h5>To your left.</h5> 

<p>Suddenly she quickly turned to her left, as if she had some kind of feeling to, maybe it was recalling for where she heard it, going that direction that took the other two behind her a moment to process it then followed with, till then reached an open within the forest to be meted with someone who was there who was checking around quickly, trying to remain calm as if they encountered something of some sort that scared this person, looking to be some kind of skeleton like Sans, but had horns and wore a hoodie with a black hood, white sleeves and the rest a burgundy color that had a symbol on the back being a light yellow star of some kind, seen with light gray pants of some kind that look quite like sweatpants that had a loose end along with what looks like light yellow slippers. Truly a lot to study of this person, that then heard the other two slow down once caught up with, looking as well while they both took a moment to breath from that. </p>

<p>It took a moment before Brook tried to go over, maybe to try and comfort them, but by one step that caused the snow to crunch from underneath when she did so, caused this horned skeleton to look over quickly at them all that caused a startled scream and watched them step back, yelling at them all in a panic. “W-WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE AND WHAT DO YOU WANT!??” Once he did, Brook stepped back, showing they aren’t trying to approach for harm, but also worried if this skeleton may try anything, which caused Bendy to notice and react fast to it, stepping in front of Brook to protect her right away in case. “Look- uh- we aren’t here to hurt you, just trying to handle this madness and want to help y-” “OH NO! NO NO NO NO NO- YOUR PLANNING TO- NO NO THAT’S- UH- UH- D-DON’T GO ANY FURTHER IN TRYING! OR I- H- I MEAN I- WILL STOP YOU!” Seemed to quickly cast a fire into their hands, looking at them ready to fight in case they are a threat, which made Brook step back a bit more causing Bendy to be on guard even more, causing Sans even to step in as well readying to use any magic he has himself too for if this is going to be some kind of battle. “OH LISTEN HERE BUDDY! WE AIN’T GONNA STOP AT NOTHING! WE ARE GONNA HELP THIS WORLD AND IF WE GOTTA HAVE SANS BLAST YEAH TO BITS WE WO-” </p>

<p>“WHAT!?? B-BLAST- I- UH- UHM- I- WELL YOU CAN’T UH- CONTINUE IF YOU UH- CAN’T UH- UHHH-” The horned skeleton tried to make an excuse, trying to think quickly, till just quickly began to run quickly away just quite scared at the moment to even fight, it’s a wonder why they’re so scared. “DAMMIT! THEY ARE GETTING AWAY! Well hey least they aren’t in the w-” During when Bendy said that suddenly Brook began to run right away after them, which caused Bendy to shout after her a “HEY!” which caused Sans to have an annoyed sigh as this involves more running, making him want to have a nap after this, following after both of them now trying to keep up with the two. Surely this has yet developed into a chase, why was she running after them she wanted to ask herself, but she felt the need to, maybe they had answers she felt, maybe they had- “WATCH OUT!” suddenly felt tackled down landing on the ground that the snow cushioned the fall, with Bendy keeping Brook down while one of those creatures jumped over both them and hit into the tree as if trying to attack her, which Bendy got up, pulling Brook back up with, leading the way now. “COME ON! I SAW WHERE THEY WENT!” Bendy shouted, leading the way, while can hear Sans from behind shooting at the creatures to keep them back with some kind of skeleton like blaster that was able to really handle these creatures with ease, but now isn’t the time to focus on that, it’s time to focus on another skeleton that seems to have horns of sorts versus Sans who doesn’t, maybe they have an answer to what’s going on or an idea to say. </p>

<p>They all were running as quick as they could, trying to go after the horned skeleton they slightly saw, quickly growing through all the trees trying to blend in with the darkness as a way to help themselves escape, terrified of the worst, while during this was having to dodge those creatures left and right like they heard them go by and saw an opportunity to strike, or maybe that horned skeleton is making the creatures go after them, that could be it too. </p>

<h5>Behind you.

</h5><p>Suddenly Brook felt an instinct to turn around, seeing Sans trying to fend off a creature that caused her to think, yelling out a “HEY!” to turn the creatures attention to herself, which it worked quickly, causing the creature to charge to her, which she quickly tried to react fast, turning to hide by a tree to let it dash by and hit into a tree to knock it out, looking over to where Sans is to make sure they’re okay, who looked back as if he hadn’t suspected it, but gave a small thumbs up in response. Now that’s handled wi- well right when that thought was yet happening suddenly a creature threw her right to the ground into some snow, keeping her down and roaring loudly at her, she struggled and tried to get free but no luck, what even are these creatures is what she wondered, till heard something crack, looking to where, can see a branch was about to break from above and hit the creature, so got ready to move, which then suddenly it crashed down landing right on the creature and making it fall back and let go as she got out quickly, that was a close one to say she was lucky for. Till suddenly quickly felt her arm get hold of again and heard a yell “COME ON YOU NEARLY GOT HURT!” which looked to see it was Bendy, following with now quickly, thank goodness she got through that one on her own in some sense, should though learn from these two perhaps how to keep focus of any danger around if anything. </p>

<p>The three ran and ran, each taking a turn to focus on the other and follow after where they headed while the other two try to handle the dangers around either distracting them or properly defeating them, till they reached to then a spot that was yet a dead end, everyone tired out from all of that running even the horned skeleton that was ahead that may be tired out, was still scared trying to see if there’s a way out, but nothing but large thick trees that surrounded them along with that cold air that was in some sense refreshing for how warm one may be from all that running, which surely made Brook try and take a moment to breath along with Sans, being tiring for both them except for Bendy who seemed although tired, was able to continue to be right on his feet, and talk right to the horned skeleton who tried to see if there is a way out. “Alright listen buddy! There’s nowhere left for you to run! So better not try anything else or you will have to face us!” once Bendy spoke up, the horned skeleton turned quickly, jumping a bit hearing such a thing as was startled to hear that all so suddenly that made his eye sockets that had that one odd light yellow light that was shaped like a diamond of some kind fade away for a moment, before showed back up to watch it check around quickly for if there is any sort of escape then at the three again. “L-LOOK! Uh- you really uh- don’t know who you are messing with! I mean it- uh-” the horned skeleton spoke back, making one another give looks to one another before looking at the horned skeleton, Brook managing to regain some more energy to try talking with as well. “We aren’t going to hurt you… Well yes the other two said they may, but that’s only if you’re a threat. We simply just want a few answers to this, to understand what this portal stuff is! The least you can do is maybe give us your name.” Can tell this caused the horned skeleton to think and attempt to calm down, which caused Bendy to look over at Brook, giving a thumbs up to that for the words she said just now. </p>

<p>The horned skeleton seemed to think for a moment, looking at the three to see if they are planning to try anything of sorts, but all showed they truly don’t mean any rather showing there hands it isn’t holding any weapon or preparing any attack, and all stayed in one spot for where they are, which although Bendy did attempt to go closer Sans stopped him for it wouldn’t be a good idea to do so, which due to that the horned skeleton spoke up. “Uh… well, this is- unsuspected if you ask me for all of this… look- uh- my name is DDraig- I am uh- not from this universe like others around uhhh- and uh- look it isn’t safe to go trying to search for a way to stop it! That can l-lead you too… danger… UH- LOOK I UH- GOT TO GO I THINK SO UH-” “NOW HANG ON! YOU’RE LEAVING NOW??? WELL GONNA NEED SOME KIND OF EXPLANATION TO WHAT THAT IS!” Bendy spoke back that startled the DDraig, making DDraig step back, which Sans gave him a look for doing that made Bendy realize he may have scared him some more. “Look uh- UH- I CAN’T SAY WHAT IT IS- IT’S- BAD- DARK TO CALL IT- Now I should get going before he-” </p>

<p>“No! No- you’re staying, now what do you mean he?” Bendy tried to speak back before suddenly felt a dash past Bendy and Brook that caused Brook to hold her necklace tightly from, seeing DDraig pass by and yell “NO TIME TO TALK! UH- BYE! AND PLEASE- DON’T GO TOWARDS THE DANGER-” as soon the horned skeleton known as DDraig was yet gone from the three’s sight, which caused Sans to watch then look over at the other two. “Well that was ‘clever’ to do” “OH COME ON! LEAST WE GOT SOME ANSWERS SANS!” Bendy spoke back when Sans spoke up about it, which Brook was silent, looking to where DDraig ran off to, thinking, they mentioned there being this he of some kind, who are they? What if they are to answer to the madness, maybe even a clue, a clue on a clue to say, making her look over at the two again who were discussing what way to try again for this as if planning to go back after them, which made her take a moment and speak up now. “Alright, you two, I think I know where we need to go to not only find that DDraig person again, but maybe a potential hint to what could be causing all of this.” </p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Under That Hood</h2>

<p>Walking, walking through the odd forest this place has, walking along the path that is all so bright and colorful and the trees bringing together this brightness it provides for them as they walk through this place, it’s a wonder how does this place exist perhaps? How do many places even exist? Guess it’s all just one the biggest mysteries there is on all of this, for now one must focus on the goal now, follow that unique fellow they met before and see if they will lead them to this guy who could supposedly be of danger and one of those other helpers of whoever is causing this stuff. “Now wait, wait, wait, so you're telling me Sans, your brother really did that stuff???” Bendy asked while walking with which Sans sighed in a bit of annoyance perhaps from all these questions he had been asked the whole time they all were walking together. “Yes, yes he did that stuff.” Sans said in an annoyed tone but Bendy wasn’t phased by that tone but more so excited on this, really enjoying learning this family stuff. </p>

<p>“WOW! That’s awesome! Your brother sounds awesome, Sans! Who knew brothers are like that! Are all brothers amazing like that?? Makes me wish I had one!” Bendy smiled, wondering all so much what it is like while Brook and Mugman watch as the two chatted during all of this. “They seem like they get along quite in a funny way! Right?” Mugman asked, looking at Brook with a curious smile on his face. “Well, most of the time hehe, but I feel they would both get real close some day, just maybe not today hehe” Brook said which made Mugman laugh a little to it as then it seems he thought of something making him look at Brook again with curiosity. “Well what about you and the other two? I mean you seem really close with Bendy!” <em>Brother…Don’t hurt me…</em> </p>
 
<p>“Huh? Oh I don’t think I am that close, although he is really nice for really wanting to help me with this, probably because I am the first human he’s met. Although on Sans now, it’s tough, I find him to be clever with what he can come up with but he seems he doesn’t really open up at all though, probably because we’re still strangers to him.” Brook answered Mugmans question, making her look ahead to the other two where Bendy is talking away at Sans who is making comments back, seeing how Bendy looked over for a moment, giving a wave, then went back to talking to Sans. “Oh! Hm… Kind of like someone I knew back home, they weren’t big on many people but they then began to open up the more I spent time with them and they were great! So maybe that’s the same with Sans, Which I think he is lucky to meet you guys for you are both really nice!” Mugman said with a smile, looking ahead now as well smiling at the two who are ahead, surely he is staying all so positive about all of this, it’s nice. </p>

<p>“Well don’t exclude yourself out of it, you’re a part of this group now, I think as well you’d get along with everyone here in which you already are.” Brook said, looking at Mugman now who looked back listening to what was said, making him smile to hear that he is accepted into this group now so he isn’t alone in any way. “Hehe! I can tell now how the rest are comfortable with you now really, such a brave sweet person even if you don’t seem to have powers but your kindness does seem it’s your power!” Mugman said, looking to Brook then looked ahead seeing Bendy and Sans still talking and Bendy seemed to bug Sans to try and get answers from him on some sort of topic but Sans doesn’t seem to be budging, looks like he has to step in for it in a second. </p>

<p>“COME ON YOU CAN’T JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT! WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM??” Bendy shouted, interrupting mostly the focus Brook and Mugman had when chatting to focus now on Bendy and Sans to try and find out what they could both be talking about. “Just don’t worry about it, alright? You got your idea on an answer, I won’t say more.” Sans said back at Bendy who he stared at for a moment then looked away to focus on walking onward, making Bendy stare at Sans seeing that then looked down, seeming surely disappointed in himself for this sort of thing. “Uhm… Are you both okay?? You both seem upset…” Mugman said, looking at Sans and Bendy in which both looked over to hearing that, both staying silent for a moment on this. “It’s nothing Mugman-” “Sans how can that be nothing?? It’s something clearly, something that I didn’t mean to do here!” Bendy interrupted Sans, seeing how Bendy looked at Sans with worry while Sans then looked back, can tell he was thinking even on what to feel seeing his shift in serious look to be more shocked or worried in some way. </p>

<p>“You didn’t mean to?.” “COURSE I DIDN’T MEAN TO! I didn’t realize it would hurt you here!” Bendy said right back with worry in his tone which made Sans go silent once getting the answer to that, surely did come as quite the surprise to hear that. Before more could be yet said though can hear roaring from COTS up ahead which made the four all look to where that came from, all preparing for what it could yet be such a thing, Brook quickly taking the lead without fear began to head onward to that way to check what it was with the rest beginning to follow quickly with. Upon nearing there though suddenly a COTS was thrown right past them making everyone move aside from that and move to a side to hide for who knows if it’s those strong flying COTS from before or some crowd just attacking one another again.</p>

<p>“Is everyone good??” “eugh, I feel I almost moved too quickly..” Sans said after Brooks' question, seeming to process it while Bendy seemed to look at him and spoke up with a “Your welcome!” before quieting down now to focus on what was going on in which what to be seen was yet quite the surprise. Someone yet to be found seen wearing a dull magenta and dull purple mixture of a hood with a maroon scar like pattern scattered across it while they wore a french violet scarf like thing on their neck and wore black boots with a belt with a leather dark brown strap on them and the silver buckle part matched with the pants that stood out from the rest of this maroon theme. </p>

<p>Which seems as though this fellow was fighting back these COTS going after them quickly as if seeing them as a threat but yet they fought them off quickly with yet quite the surprising amount of power that glowed a maroon in their hands till a lot of the rest that kept coming began to flee now as they stood watching as the creatures did so as they checked around and looked to ahead to see how there was yet a portal there perhaps from where they came from, then looked away as if waiting now for something to happen. “Wait… Wait wait wait- I recognize that guy- actually we all should in some way- isn’t that the guy from the last universe who talked with DDraig??” Bendy whispered pointing out what he could figure which made Brook look to hear that then back to where this fellow is, same height, same shaping, same horns, same attitude… Bendy does seem he is right, that must be that Stiex guy from before. </p>

<p>“Wait, that gives me an idea..” Brook whispered, looking at Stiex then reached into her odd version of her hood to get the mini drawing book and pencil out which both looked different as well, a lot more purple these two things and the cover of the book had some odd symbol that may mean something but she didn’t worry to much now. She then flipped open to a page to begin to try and draw out how this Stiex guy looked for what she can see of how he looks from this distance doing what she can to see what’s about him which the rest stayed silent for until heard a familiar unique tone voice that seemed to come over saying “STIEXY!~” as loudly as ever like they want the world to know it and it seems it had bothered Stiex from hearing that. </p>

<p>“STIEXY!~ Ohhh Stiexy you got to hear about the group I met today~” “Would you not call me that for fucks sake Alovo?” Stiex said, looking at the familiar fellow known as Alovo who still grinned all the same whilst coming over. “Oh but you got to hear about each one!~ Oh how sexy and innocent all of them were with oh so many urges~” Alovo continued which seems Stiex just ignored mostly while Alovo began to rant because of Stiex not speaking up. “Sheesh I didn’t suspect this guy to know this kind of person here.” Bendy said in a whisper looking at the rest. “Well hopefully he isn’t suffering too bad with all this talk then, but it is odd how they know one another.” “And this guy knew DDraig who knew that Balaur guy, isn’t this getting a bit too connected here?.” Sans spoke up after Brook did in a whisper which seems to cause both Brook and Bendy to think while Mugman just seemed more so confused about who these people they talk of but did his best to understand what it could be. </p>

<p>“I mean, he seems like he is a good guy,” Mugman said in a whisper, glancing over to where Stiex and Alovo were unable to figure out what they were talking about but was focused on the conversation here. “I don’t know, he seems like a downer more than someone nice.” Bendy said in a whisper looking to where it all was now seeming to have a suspicion on the guy in some sense but seems he isn’t sticking to much with such a theory as if considering he could be good. “Well, he should be someone good, if DDraig was alright with him that means this guy must be trying something around here.” Brook said in a whisper before looking back which the rest did as well, perhaps curious now for what could be talked about now between these two further away from this four person group. </p>

<p>“Aw come on Stiexy~ You're reallllyyy going to go do that?~ Come onnnn~ Can you at least save his d-""I’m not saving any shit like that.” Stiex interrupted what Alovo was saying which Alovo wasn’t bothered by clearly. “Aw fine~ Though I’m surprised you’re so daring to do such a task alone with no partner to do it with~ Maybe should get one of us to or even find a lost sexy helper out there~” Alovo suggested, going closer to where Stiex was which seems Stiex wasn’t scared by but just gave more of a look of perhaps judgment and confusion. “Yeah, no, fuck that, not doing that shit, even if there wouldn’t be anyone whos fucking crazy to do that.” “Ohhh~ Yet there always is just the hole that fits for everyone now~” Alovo responded to what Stiex said which Stiex just gave a bit of a look that seemed grossed out while Alovo only just kept grinning. </p>

<p>“This is fucking getting off topic here Alovo, Look, Just keep note on what I said for what’s to happen, got it?” Stiex said, looking at Alovo during all of this who yet only grinned. “Well Stiexy~ You are so strong for doing such a thing even when those other people won’t even show up in a while~” Alovo added which seemed Stiex already had some sort of answer figured out for a situation like that. “They will show up in a few hours there, sooner if something has happened on their behalf, which would mean it’s faster to stop this hell.” Stiex answered, looking to Alovo and then looked away, which Alovo tried to get closer but Stiex quickly put his hand up to make Alovo stop where he was so he wouldn’t get anymore closer. </p>

<p>“So that Balaur guy could’ve gone there then! HAH! Got a lead!” Bendy whispered in excitement to this knowledge now which Sans shushed him for he was getting a bit loud. “Quiet down Bendy, don’t want to be caught here otherwise we can be in danger, we saw the strength of the guy” Sans whispered which Bendy did at least seem to somewhat listen. “I think he wouldn’t use it though since maybe we could be helping the guy handle those bad people” Mugman whispered while looking to where Stiex and Alovo were seeming to be arguing about something but it’s hard to figure what. </p>

<p>“Well it’s really good to see people like that Mugman, I even think you got a point there.” Brook whispered, looking to Mugman before looking away to focus on trying to draw out how he looks for later note on anything like needing the guys appearance to figure if it’s him or if anyone they run into could confirm some things about him. “I don’t see what’s good in him though, what if he wants to actually gather them so they can initiate some very big bad plan that could worsen the portal stuff going on now” Bendy whispered, looking to the rest wondering if they are thinking the same in which can tell there was doubt on the faces of everyone but they were thinking on as a rare what if for it. <em>Bigger danger…</em></p>

<p>“Look, just keep that in mind Alovo, got it?” Stiex spoke, which made the four continue to listen again, able to see how he was readying to turn to get going now. “Aww~ You’re really gonna leave me here all alone now?~ What about all these scary daring people around here now that could do such horrible things?~” Alovo said, going closer to where Stiex is which made Stiex look over as if figured out what exactly he meant by it and sighed. “Alovo, do what you can to make it through even then, alright? At least do so till I can stop this, Just if it gets- scary? Whatever the fuck you put in your terms, but if it does, just try and remember that.” Stiex said, which made Alovo only nod while still having the same expression as Stiex seemed to just be a bit relieved once saw that now. </p>

<p>Stiex then looked away now readying to go through the portal but paused suddenly, and seemed to then quickly look in the direction for where the four others were hiding in which before he could see they all hid except Brook struggled to keep up hiding with even though was probably seen now anyways, in which then there was silence as to not be heard or seen. Stiex though didn’t look away and stared at a specific spot for where Brook had hid because of her being late, just feeling almost everything frozen when looking at him when this danger looked back able to see those glowing red eyes when he did. This is bad. Just felt as though there was some way to read his mind or something like that, like nobody else could hear but it’s between them, which only was sending chills to it all. </p>

<p>“...You’re not normal.” it seemed Stiex practically said while it already felt the area was just darkness almost just nobody else was there but the two still in the forms this universe put them in. “Wh- Wa-” “Too abnormal. Seems to have a motivation, but they wouldn’t succeed alone, so why are they out here? Hm, questions for another time.” Stiex interrupted but seems more it was not intentional, like he doesn’t know she can hear, before then seems those glowing red eyes of his looked away and before one could speak up suddenly felt pulled back quickly feeling just a lot more of the bush because of it while yet can watch as Stiex left through that portal once again.</p>

<p>“BROOK ARE YOU NUTS!?? YOU COULD’VE BEEN ATTACKED THERE BECAUSE OF HIM SEEING YOU HERE!!” Bendy now just shouted, just beginning to shake Brook a bit in an angry but worried panic way before being slapped across the back of the head that made him let go. “Bendy, quiet down! You’re risking us to be caught here.” Sans hissed, trying to keep quiet still but can tell he was getting angry at Bendy which Bendy looked back at him in some surprise that he did that. “Well excuse me for worrying even when those guys left already!” Bendy hissed back, gesturing over to where Alovo was to see how Alovo was continuing onward like before now. </p>

<p>“Guys calm down! Look Brook is alright here, right??” “Yeah, I am… just-” Yet Brook couldn’t say more after what Mugman said before being interrupted hearing screams ahead, they probably should get to following quickly now so they won’t lose track of him again huh? Well onward they must go then. The four then began to quickly hurry on now to quickly be sure to keep up and not lose track of the guy while Brook was left thinking on what happened, what an odd moment to occur, it wasn’t normal in any way, was almost like it was something out of her control in an odd way, but what is she to do about that? The group continued on during this, keeping close in following behind Alovo during this while there could have been unanswered things throughout the group but not much can be done for it, but seems some have plans to change that for Brook then felt a tap on her shoulder causing her to slow down while the other two hurried on ahead, making Brook look over and see Bendy. “Brook?, you doing alright?” Bendy asked, having a worried expression on his face. “Yeah, I’m alright, why do you ask?” “Just… I don’t know, earlier you seemed kind of stunned by something, like you weren’t fully there with us so I wanted to ask.” Bendy answered Brooks' question, making Brook give Bendy a bit of a worried look upon hearing that. </p>

<p>“Bendy, I wish I knew myself what happened earlier, but, it’s like something happened that- I think made me view that Stiex guys mind, I don’t know it sounds nuts saying that but maybe it was a power of his or-” “Brook I came from a place with people that are out of their minds, this is not nuts in any way to me.” Bendy interrupted at least for a moment which made Brook relax more upon hearing that for at least someone would believe in them for this sort of thing. “It just, the whole thing was odd saying this thing on being abnormal and seemed to figure what could be what at least I want to do about all of this madness..” “That’s odd to happen, makes me worry about this guy more, even what he has to do with someone that’s causing all of this chaos, so many questions but there are so little answers like always.” Bendy responded to what Brook had said, able to tell he was thinking on it quietly for what was said, trying to piece together what it could all mean which can’t blame him for. </p>

<p>“Hey, you two, hurry up, don’t want to lose track of this guy.” Sans shouted back at the two, making the two look over, making Bendy look onward readying to continue on right away but stopped to look at Brook to see if she would follow.</p>

<h5>Watch out.</h5>

<p>Another thing echoing in Brooks head, making her look around for a second before then saw something like a large tree was coming down almost looking picked up and dropped down to around where Bendy was, that’s not good. “WATCH OUT!” Brook shouted while quickly pulling Bendy away and watching the other two ahead quickly move aside to once hearing Brooks shout seeing how it crashed down having all the four just dodge it now. “DEAR INKY LORD- WHERE THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM NOW!??” Bendy shouted, looking to the tree before looking to Brook who was taking a moment to breathe, that was a close one. “I wish I knew myself… Sans! Mugman! You okay!??” Brook shouted the end bit now looking to where Sans and Mugman were being on the other side, hearing a shout back from Mugman saying “WE’RE OKAY!” which is reassuring, Mugman is trustworthy when it comes to this stuff after all. </p>

<p>“Alright! We’ll try coming over!” Bendy shouted back, as went over to where the large tree was beginning to try and climb over it. “Uh- Bendy?” “What Brook? What is- oh- do humans not know how to climb or- well actually the only way i’m climbing this is by sticking and- you're not sticky are you?” Bendy asked Brook now, which Brook gave a nod, surely a weird way to phrase that but it makes sense with the context. “Right- Okay, this will be tougher to get by. Alright, I will see if I can find a way for you to get up then!” Bendy figured for some way through this, beginning to then stop climbing and focus on searching for a way for Brook to be able to while Brook studied the area around for ideas even how the tree fell down. “Brook, Bendy! Do I need to send a blaster over to get you both out?” Sans shouted back which although he doesn’t have the loudest shout he still tried which was still possible to hear from the side there on, well there surely is the other solution. “Hey! Good thinking there Sans! Alright! Send them ova here!” Bendy shouted back, stepping aside from the tree to check if the blaster would show, which seems in a few minutes it did pretty quickly, a quick easy way over. But then, when the blaster tried to come over suddenly can see a shadow charge at it being a storm of those flying COTS tackling it down as the blaster tried to shoot at these flying COTS it couldn’t and was destroyed by it, hearing a shouted “RUN!” from Mugman on the other side of this which then caused this for now split group to run away which seems a part of the section of the crowd began to fly after Brook and Bendy while the other half went after Sans and Mugman, that’s bad.</p>

<p>Quickly Brook tried to run ahead while Bendy followed behind pretty quickly which seems they looked to the flying COTS behind them thinking fast before getting hold of Brook by the wrist before pulling her quickly to the side to where a tree was making quickly both of them go into it but then out into the near top of the tree making them hide within the leaves of it while the flying COTS must’ve mistaken it as them turning there route and zoomed by the tree quickly to be gone which now gave Bendy and Brook a moment to breathe now. “You alright?” Bendy asked while taking a moment to breathe from that, checking around for if there are any other dangers around that came unnoticed but there wasn’t any. “Yeah, I’m okay, surely there was some creative thinking you did there.” “Pfft! That wasn’t creative thinking Brook, just an instinct, but come on, Let’s go find the rest, okay?” Bendy looked to Brook while saying that, offering his hand out as an offer to help Brook down which she looked at for a moment before accepting it. </p>

<h5>A split between two with two different ideas…</h5>
<h5>One more within good and sweet…</h5>
<h5>The other more within bad and twisted nature…</h5>

<h2>Chapter 12. Strange Science</h2>

<p>“AH- WHO IN THE INKY HELL ARE YOU!??” Bendy shouted, as the rest backed a bit away ready incase this person was of any danger. Looking upon this danger can see as though they appeared odd for it seemed to be someone wearing a black tophat with a pair of horns poking through as this fellow wore an science like lab coat that was a rusty pink that had a odd robot like appeal to it with a pair of pants to match with the color scheme of it, able to see there boots being a dark jam color as can see the fellow as well had white messy hair with stripes in it being of a brink coloration as can see despite his eyes being pretty shadowed can see the glasses they wore underneath that really hid how there eyes looked. </p>

<p>“MY MY! I didn't mean to give quite the surprise! I just overheard you folks talking and couldn’t help but be excited to hear about such intelligence! Even by the looks you appear to have such great power! Quite perfect for- some things.” This scientist-like fellow explained why they seemed to happen to interrupt of sorts which does make some reasonable sense for that. “Wait how do-” “What does this have to do with us though?” Sans interrupted Bendy but not entirely by intention but mostly just to get a question answered. “Well I figured perhaps when seeing you folks you could be the perfect way to help me with something that became quite the situation due to all of this chaos!” The scientist-like person explained more, which makes this quite interesting, maybe a clue on who could be causing chaos in this universe. </p>

<p>“Oh, Of course we can help you mister! Right guys?” Mugman asked the rest, looking over to the rest who all kind of exchanged looks amongst one another quietly on what to think upon this. “I mean, it would be the most friendly thing to do.” Brook spoke up, looking at this scientist fellow who only watched the rest with a smile that felt odd, but she isn’t sure why. “Hm, it depends.” “HEY SCIENTIST GUY! What do you have to offer if we help you!??” Bendy asked in a bit of a shout which startled Sans for a second at first but he calmed down quickly. “What do I have to offer? Why the perfect machinery to help you with all sorts of course! Whatever machine you’d like I will give to you! Just if you help me with a little problem from a pest that keeps ruining things!” The scientist fellow answered with quite the explanation to all of this, which really can get the rest to think more upon this. </p>

<p>Everyone looked to one another exchanging one another looks upon this sort of offer just thinking of what to do exactly for if to do so or not, which even then shouldn’t hurt after all, right? Can try it and maybe it could help them figure out who could be causing chaos in this universe faster. “Alright, we’ll help you out!” Brook spoke up for everyone, looking over to this scientist fellow who yet smiled more upon hearing that. “WONDERFUL! BRILLIANT EVEN! Now how rude of me as well to not introduce myself! Fellow people I am Uvilein! And I thank you for being so willing to help me!” The fellow now known as Uvilein exclaimed while giving a proper introduction to them now as he smiled with that slight oddness to it that remained, but shouldn’t have to worry and question it now. “Now,Now! No time to waste fellow people! We got something to handle!” Uvilein then spoke up again, turning around and beginning to lead the way as the rest began to follow along now.</p>

<p>Although while they’re walking Brook was able to notice Bendy was seeming off upon this sort of thing, carefully going over to them and spoke up in a small whisper, “Are you alright?” which yet made Bendy quickly look at her in surprise hearing that. “Brook! I’m- good just… I don’t think this guy is safe, somethings off… Why would anyone be so calm like that and not affected in some way and how come they want specifically our help? Like I get we are all a strong team here but- well we’ve seen stronger!” Bendy explained while keeping it as a whisper, just constantly making sure Uvilein wasn’t listening but seems Uvilein was being caught up on being talked to by Mugman who was being there usual sweet and friendly self. “Hm, Well, I can see what you mean for off actually, like that smile isn’t- normal or natural, like it has more to it then it seems, but I believe you Bendy, like how you have with me.” Brook responded in that whisper tone, giving Bendy a small smile which yet got Bendy smiling back at her knowing he wasn’t alone for this one. “So you want us to handle some problem that deals with pests?” Sans asked Uvilein, causing Bendy and Brook to look over and listen in now. “Well actually, It’s more you deal with the pests that began showing around even where I was working! That’s where I will yet give you a gift of a variety of things to help you on your journey!” Uvilein exclaimed, looking over to Sans with that odd smile of his then he looked on ahead once again. </p>

<p>“How far is it by chance?” Brook asked now which made Uvilein look a bit over with that same smile on his face. “Quite far dare I say! But not to worry dear girl! We’ll be there in no time!” Uvilein answered, looking to her then ahead while fixing the hat they wore on their head a bit during this, quite odd to even get a nickname to think. “Heyyy- That’s weird for you to call her that now!” Bendy spoke up, giving Uvilein a bit of a look which made everyone look to Uvilein now due to its familiarity in some way. “But I don’t happen to know her name, in fact I am clueless on all of yours so nicknames work after all, right demon boy?” Uvilein looked to Bendy now as that was said, making Bendy go quiet upon hearing that, as Uvilein once again looked ahead while continuing onward now. </p>

<p>The group continued to follow Uvilein who leaded pass the several trees and through every odd section of sorts, while yet there didn’t appear many COTS bugged, which yet made Brook look to Bendy due to noticing the lack of them which Bendy looked around as well then to Brook, both having the same look of knowing something was off, clearly wrong at that and who knows if Sans and Mugman had noticed it. “Uhm… Uvilie- Sir- Why isn’t there many COTS around? Normally there’s quite a few when we walk around here…” Mugman asked now, which made the rest look to Mugman which Uvilein now slowly looked at Mugman, giving that same smile during this, that oddness was still there for it that Brook knew checking Bendy slightly Bendy did not trust for a second. </p>

<p>“That would be the help of one of my gadgets now! A COTS repellant very well to help keep all COTS far back from you! Was quick to develop in these cases!” Uvilein explained while pulling out a gadget to show off this odd round orb like spray that surely seems it must’ve been freshly made which Mugman looked at the object curiously once it was shown and so as the rest except Bendy who had a suspicious look to it. “Now hang on, First off how would you even be able to invent that quickly even figuring what the COTS would dislike since that's often how repellants tend to work and Secondly, If this works so well how come you didn’t put it around the place your stuff is so it’s safe and it would’ve never been at risk?” Bendy asked which made Uvilein look at him giving a look that seemed to be growing annoyed but yet still smiled like it’s all normal, odd. </p>

<p>“Well now what an observation little- inky creature, But this is just showcasing my intelligence, you see I haven’t had the chance to make around when such an incident happened as those creatures broke in and messed with everything, but while in the process got scared off by something they very well disliked, I took this to my advantage to create something quickly to be able to have ready a tool to help as of course with great intelligence you are able to figure the exact way to create something quickly such as that now, wouldn’t you?” Uvilein explained, mostly staring at Bendy with this look that still was there but it grew to be a snarky like look that yet had intelligence mostly in it while he smiled before he looked away to keep on going ahead which left Bendy quietly annoyed by this. While they walked, Uvilein stayed ahead and focused onwards, while the rest followed behind, Mugman attempting to understand them and be all so friendly but yet feels like something is off, which makes Brook look to Bendy seeming to just believe him more for what he said before about this guy, something seems off and perhaps nothing good, even for there reaction to Bendy saying that just seemed more off, but hopefully it just really is nothing here and it’s just how this person is. </p>

<p>Continuing onward, there wasn’t far to much aside from the same patterns around for location here and there, which while they walked, Brook studied around for any signs perhaps Alovo could be around since they were following him maybe he’s around here, who knows if he’s even along this path at that, but then again there’s always possibilities. Which yet while going along, can notice someone ahead, that yet studying enough can figure to be Alovo, There he is! Which yet though can feel Bendy seemed to tug on Brooks sleeve for a moment to quietly point out Uvilein who seems to be putting his hand secretly into his sleeve for a moment, doing something that’s hard to figure what, before taking it out again in an odd manner, surely leaves more suspicion and proves Bendys theory more. </p>

<p>“Ah! It appears something just as pesky is yet ahead of us now! Oh no and I recognize it all so easily that this pest was what showed along with those horrible creatures taking and wrecking my precious home!” Uvilein sobbed, as he hid more over to where Sans and Mugman were while seeming to dig into his coat to find a small machinery to help with this. “Oh! Look guys it’s Alovo! He doesn’t mean harm though he-” “AH!! THE PEST IS APPROACHING US!” Uvilein interrupted Mugman, as Alovo looked over, holding tight to his arm for a moment almost like it hurt but yet began to grin before he began to approach quickly, that’s bad, even odd that small behavior for a second there. </p>

<p>“Ooooo!~ The old playmates with another playmate, Oh how fun~” Alovo spoke as he seemed to press one of the heart shaped bells on his hat that summoned up a weapon above him that was a large hammer of sorts as he got that ready, that’s odd but bad too. “Wait- Wait Alovo it’s us you know we aren’t here to hurt you look we just-” “Awwww~ But I don’t need your help now~ Me and some others got an army to help us!~” Alovo interrupted Brook, just seeming to lift his hand up as if to call upon something. Which then within a few seconds came some flying COTS coming straight down to be beside Alovo acting as enemies in a way, but how? Was there COTS theory wrong for who's bad and who's good now? Unless there's more to it than what meets the eye. “OH HO! FELLAS! We are in for a fight I see! But don’t you worry! I won't let this foul beast hurt you good and helpful people!” Uvilein spoke, while seeming to reach into the coat they wore to grab something, or so to guess they could be since there still is a few suspicions on them now after all. </p>

<p>Uvilein then pulls out a machine of some kind shaped like a projectile launching type of weapon, aiming it right at Alovo, then smiled almost mad like as he pulls the trigger and caused a giant pink web like net to go over Alovo and the COTS there but the COTS flew at it quickly and moved it away but caught them in the process, but the way it was surely was odd, but yet can then see Alovo charging at Uvilein now who quickly moved behind Bendy to use as a shield which Bendy struggled and tried to make Uvilein let go of him so he isn’t some shield now, that’s bad. But yet Sans reacted quickly summoning bones in front of Bendy to create a shield that Alovo hit his hammer against breaking each of them which gave Bendy time to get free and quickly move away so Alovo charges at Uvilein who put up a weird shield fast around himself as Alovo tries to attack at it. “N-No wait! We shouldn’t have to fight now! Alovo come on… we aren’t here to hurt you we can all be fri-” “Oh ho~ What fun innocence I hear~ Oh what would it be like to wreck that now?~” Alovo interrupted Mugman, which Alovo quickly then began to charge at Mugman which Bendy reacted fast to pick Mugman up and move him away to protect him, which Alovo hit into that spot but looked to them quickly aiming but Mugman quickly shot a magic bullet into the spot in between his eyes so both him and Bendy can get away from any range of an attack. Which did leave Alovo confused for a second which yet Brook was going to go in to try and help but Uvilein stopped her quickly, which made her confused and looked to Uvilein on why they did that.</p>

<p>“Now Now! Silly girl you don’t run into danger like that! You need a weapon! Luckily this universe happens to magic up one for you usually! So let’s seeee” Uvilein then began to check around her for what could possibly be it to guess which confused her and surely felt uncomfortable for how it was, while yet made her look to the rest who still were fighting at Alovo who kept managing to be quick and handling the attacks fast but was able to notice the little details of twitching on the head, like a pain twitch, odd. “Ah Hah! Let’s see if this book and pencil could be it!” Uvilein spoke up, reaching over to go into Brooks pocket to attempt to grab it which made her quickly stop Uvilein from doing so. “No, no it’s okay I can grab it just- let me-” “Nonsense! Don’t worry I won’t peek at a thing if you're so worried about that now!” Uvilein interrupted while continuing to go ahead and try to grab it which yet once got a hold of it suddenly just saw a bone hit Uvilein hard right into the head making Uvilein drop it, causing Brook to quickly grab it again. <em>Help…</em> </p>

<p>“SHE SAID YOU DON’T HAVE TO YOU B-” “Bendy why did you hit the guy with one of my attacks?” Sans interrupted Bendy which Bendy quickly looked to Sans once hearing that, which yet made Brook look to Uvilein who seemed to quietly smile a small bit more, odd. “WELL I DON’T WANT ANOTHER BALAUR SITUATION IN THE PREVIOUS UNIVERSE!” Bendy shouted a bit back before then just got hit in the side with the hammer that knocked Sans with, which clearly was Alovo who quickly began to go after them. Which yet Brook thought quickly, getting past Uvilein while just going to where Alovo was who charged at Bendy and Sans but quickly Brook took her hood like part off to throw at Alovos head so it goes over them and there distracted, then quickly went over to knock Alovo down but Alovo got hold of her once felt her touch and tried pulling her closer but quickly bones shot out from the ground to knock both Brook and Alovo back and away from one another which Brook thanked Sans for doing that. </p>

<p>Bendy took this as an opportunity to go at Alovo but yet Uvilein quickly got to them first and aimed one of their machines at them that must be a weapon of sorts as they stepped on Alovos forehead to keep Alovo down. “And look at who's victorious now!” Uvilein proudly spoke loudly about, which Alovo could be seen quietly struggling a bit to move from it clearly, odd. “Mmmm~ Step on me harder~” Alovo spoke up while he sounded muffled in the hood that was still on him when it was thrown on. “Eugh- I forgot how gross this one is! But no worries for that now for they are yet defeated and cannot do much to hurt us after all, not even after this.” Uvilein looked to Alovo pointing the machinery to him before activating it and shooting out some sort of mechanisms that yet zapped Alovo to a level to just keep him paralyzed there it seems, which Uvilein stepped off his head, making the machinery be all back to normal before he put it back into his coat as he heads to the rest which yet the four just looked to Alovo who was now paralyzed there, odd how he didn’t react to it really for that now, all of this feels odd, well at least to Bendy and Brook here. </p>

<p>“Now that was easy, shows you folks can handle anything! But I think Brook, was it that for what Mugboy said? Yeah, you need some work but don’t worry I will teach as we walk!” Uvilein said going over to where Brook is to then have his tail guide Brook to begin walking with him as he signaled to the rest to follow with, which yet this action surely made Brook uncomfortable now. “So now! Tell me, how come you tried to stop me when I was assisting you on getting your weapon to be made?” Uvilein now asked as they walked which made Brook quietly unsure on how to answer this, confused even. “Well- uhm-” “Because she dislikes having her stuff touched! Hell even then since she's an artist she could not want anyone snooping through her art!” Bendy interrupted Brook, coming up to walk beside Brook while yet defending her in some way but just not enough, which yet made Uvilein look over but just smiled more. “Oh what a fun surprise! An artist with a special rock that yet I believe is one I have been studying that happens to be strong enough to fuel a makeshift portal due to how much power these can contain!” Uvilein then seemed to get closer to study the gem Brook wore on her necklace which yet made Brook back away a bit to be more to where Bendy is in which to notice Bendy gave a bit of a weird look at Uvilein like suspicion but curiosity. </p>

<p>“What do you mean it can fuel a portal?” Bendy asked which made Brook look to Bendy then to Uvilein, which Uvilein looked at him with a smile but yet one that seemed more snarky and suspicious. “Well if you knew the history of these things you’d get it! It’s said these gems if you were close to someone to have a deeper connection that makes you connected it can awaken the powers within these gems, which if you were to with some the strongest beings the gem can very well reach that potential no matter the cases, Course it’s not easy to achieve that silly thing! But why are you so curious now?” Uvilein explained while yet looking at Bendy with a look of suspicion but he still smiled, which yet made Brook look to Bendy as well since it is a bit of something to wonder on. “Two reasons, One is I always wondered how to make a portal before this stuff began and Secondly don’t you think that’s how all these portals could’ve been made?” “Oh ho but odd to want to make one but for what reasons? It almost sounds like you're the cause of this!” Uvilein answered what Bendy said which yet Bendy looked at Uvilein like he’s crazy, but Bendy wouldn’t want to do this, he would’ve just let what Balaur was doing play out and not save the day after all. </p>

<p>“Hey, if you're thinking of blaming him for these things he wouldn’t at all! He’s a good guy not-” “But how does anyone know! After all, people can be deceiving! He could be waiting for the right moment to strike like whoever that other guy was. Wouldn't it be suspicious if he wanted to make a portal let alone know more about these gems?” Uvilein interrupted, which yet seemed to notice Bendy was getting annoyed during this till it seems he got so angry that it just caused something to flip. “FOR FUCKS SAKE I’M NOT BAD IT’S JUST I WANTED TO ESCAPE THE DAMM INKY HELL UNIVERSE I WAS IN JUST LIKE HOW SOMEONE WHOS FAMILY TO ME DID IS THAT TO SUSPICIOUS FOR YEAH NOW YOU COVERED SHLUSTER.” Bendy shouted at Uvilein, just getting close up in his face while he was before he stepped away kind of far back just causing a silence amongst everywhere after he did that, everyone wasn’t sure what to say even Uvilein by surprise at that. The silence around remained just everyone not sure what to do aside from walking onward Uvilein being ahead but can notice Mugman seeming to walk more ahead to be beside Bendy, which Bendy looked over to Mugman seeming confused a bit why he’s nearby now. </p>

<p>“Hey, it’s okay Bendy, nobody is judging you for that… I knew some people who wanted to escape stuff to which they managed and think you're free from it now! So it’s all okay now, okay? You know you're not a bad guy at all! If you were, I'm sure you would’ve done something bad by now!” Mugman calmly spoke up, which Bendy listened in before smiling once hearing all of that as can tell he calmed down a bit. “But of course we can’t help but speculate-” “Shut up or we would change our minds on helping.” Sans interrupted Uvilein, giving Uvilein a bit of a glare before looking at Bendy and Mugman which yet just made Bendy smile more knowing these people were yet looking out for him. “I agree, I’m sure Bendy isn’t bad in any way, he has many times helped me out during situations, even when stuck with him he didn’t try a thing, which is me being honest here.” Brook spoke up now, which yet Bendy looked to her as well and just smiled some more surely calming down from all of it quickly. “Alright! Alright! Excuse my over speculation upon things! Sometimes after all when it comes to things you have to suspect every single possibility so you’re prepared for any project by chance!” Uvilein spoke, just looking to everyone then ahead now just continuing onward as though this was just some small hurdle they got into but it was now over, which at least in the end of it got Bendy to feel better so that’s good out of all of this, but it’s a wonder if everyone else here perhaps could have a suspicion on Uvilein now, but who’s to know of course, but just at least this just helped give a glimpse that everyone has gotten closer to perhaps be friends by chance. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. All a matter of Chance</h2>

<p>Frozen in place seeing the creatures surround, unknown where is the one that the group followed, unknown if anything that’s being touched is anyone at all, all that can be seen with just the small glow of magic was all the COTS that surrounded this group with little to no light around. It was clear due to what felt like a long pause in time that danger was just about to strike, but only now Brook was able to process how everyone was running now, running hearing the screaming of the COTS chasing behind them trying to see if harm could be done seeing this spider like COTS crawl all around wherever it can at high speeds seeming ready to shoot perhaps a web right at them, which once seeing one shot out can feel the tug of being pulled right to the side to dodge it hitting the ground in the process which only now to realize it was Bendy just getting her and Mugman to dodge it while seems Sans and Baldi managed to themselves easily, surely a rush for everything there is yet hardly any time to think or even realize what was being said from anyone. “OKAY WE NEED A PLAN HERE GUYS WHAT ARE WE DOING??” Bendy shouted as he pulled Mugman and Brook back up which both didn’t have an answer while beginning to run again Sans and Baldi joined in all trying to think up something it seems too. </p>

<p>“Clearly what I can tell this spider COTS of some kind needs time to recharge each time it shoots at us and even has a preparing time, so there has to be something we could do during those times clearly” Baldi pointed out for what he was able to notice as everyone kept running dodging any sudden web shots that come there way. “Alright, maybe during that time we all could trick it into shooting itself somehow” Sans spoke up, saying some plan that could work but once again it’s all unknown how’d they do it. Which once Brook heard she thought up an idea but surely a dangerous one at best, but, what other choice could they have here if so far all these COTS are surely catching up. “Can someone time how long it takes for each phase they go through?” Brook quietly spoke up which can hear Baldi get right to it which can notice slightly how Bendy did look to her curious what she has in mind again same with Mugman who did the same, to guess they must’ve figured one has some idea and are curious about it. “Takes ten seconds for each step they go through, ten to prepare the shot, ten to shoot and ten to cool down.” Baldi answered quickly while everyone still kept dodging any webs that shot out, which gave an answer surely for that. “Okay, one of you start counting for me once it’s preparing to shoot a web” Brook answered, to which Mugman seemed already willing to do so, to which Bendy gave a more concerned look once hearing that. “Brook what are you planning?” Bendy asked, which Brook only looked to him with a look that said to trust her with this. </p>

<p>Which yet can hear Mugman began to count going right in sync each move this spider like COTS made, which yet during this Brook began to get her necklace off while letting go of Mugman and Bendys hands during this but still following along with the rest which yet can tell right away how Bendy gave a concerned look so did Sans since those two yet know what’s exactly about this necklace since they all found out about it while Mugman and Baldi had confused looks on there faces, till once Mugman began to count when it was going to shoot she had the necklace in her hand turning around and stopping which seeing the COTS get closer and hearing it go to the last second she threw the necklace as far as she can which threw to behind the spider COTS causing it to turn as it shot the web right into the large crowd of COTS and some of it into its own face causing it to scream out as she quickly began to try and run in to get the necklace back now but can see Bendy dash past to get it first going into a puddle past this spider COTS and other COTS around to grab it before the other ones did then sinked into a puddle and came back handing it to Brook while saying “You surely are crazy to do that but that was awesome though” before he quickly pulled Brook by the arm to follow the rest who began to go ahead taking the chances they can while all of them should be stuck currently. “That was awesome thinking Brook!” Mugman exclaimed as they all ran while Brook just gave a smile while the darkness at least was growing weaker as they ran through so it was more possible to see where they’re going. “That really was smart thinking to do there, what gave you the idea?” Baldi asked as they went on which Brook did have to think for a moment, she just figured it would work she wasn’t confident it would but it was just putting things together, as she was going to try to answer and can tell Bendy must’ve already figured one for her. “Come on guys! Brook must’ve got it from us to figure this stuff! Got her to think even more possibilities I bet! Even then she is good at coming up with a few plans” Bendy went on, looking to Brook with a smile, which Brook gave a small smile hearing, sure even if it sounded like praise for the rest it does also feel she got it from the rest here strangely, but it’s not a bad thing at all. “That sounds more like an insult to her Bendy” Sans mumbled a bit while Bendy quickly looked at Sans with a bewildered look. </p>

<p>“EXCUSE ME??? I AM NOT EVEN IF IT SOUNDS LIKE IT I DON’T WANT TO! Though in case sorry if it did sound like it was Brook” Bendy although sure he didn’t insult her still apologized in case which just shows he is nice, making Brook smile at him hearing that and also being able to tell how he isn’t trying to be mean in any way. “Yay! Now that we got through that, now we just need to follow Solgo and hope it leads to answers for who's doing this and where my family is!” Mugman said with excitement in his voice which got everyone a bit more excited as well to not just help Mugman but get more answers on what’s going on, perhaps maybe they even could find out who is the real big cause behind all of this since all they know is there is a big boss and he is not friendly and just wants chaos to guess, it’s not fully known the reasoning. Which yet luckily they exited out the forest now into some bright and warm sunlight which is the nicest thing to feel but not to see that the world still is in danger especially how many portals are even ahead in the sky just more clusters of them further away, which yet makes it worrisome for surely a lot of things that could occur then. “Judging the distance it doesn’t appear to far those portals, perhaps a kilometer distance or more from where we are” Baldi spoke up seeming to be studying those clusters of portals that are up in the sky ahead, which yet got everyone to think on it, could be dangerous surely but, what other choice do they all got here. </p>

<p>“Well! Let’s go then!” Bendy spoke up, about to go onward but stop realizing he still kinda had hold of Brooks arm which he carefully let go once realizing before going onward now, which just made Brook a little amused how he forgot but yet begun to go onward once the rest did as she got her necklace back on as they walked making sure the gem is still there with it too which luckily it was. To think of how the journey has been going on, the dangers they come across have surely begun to raise more throughout this whole journey but yet they keep managing through it all and handling it, so it surely shouldn’t get any worse from here. Which yet soon they found that same dice the brute COTS broke out from, although sure it felt farther to get back here but yet means they all are making progress again and can even see the other side for how the size of the hole it made before, able to see a carnival almost theme on the other side which yet Mugman seemed already so excited rushing over knowing they are back to really making a lot of progress and being close for Mugman to find his family to see if they’re okay seeing him rush over to see what could be there. “YEAH! BACK ON TRACK!” Bendy shouted quickly following Mugman after to see what could be there now. </p>

<p>“That took a while.” Sans quietly kinda said but followed with though seeming to want to be sure there won’t be any dangers same with Baldi who was trailing behind the most since he wasn’t sure if it was safe, but Brook noticed and began to quietly encourage Baldi more to go onward which Baldi didn’t suspect but did respect the small bit of help. Once there it was just a matter of going in and through the other side, who knows if Solgo even fled this way or not, who even knows if Mugmans family is this way but the one hope everyone could have is how much more creatures there could be on the other side for a sign perhaps that someone who's part of these bad people could be there. Which yet once staring for a bit can hear Bendy charging in already just shouting “LET’S GET THOSE BAD GUY!” which yet Mugman followed in finding it funny how he did which got Brook to end up following to though checked back on Sans and Baldi who weren’t sure but then Baldi just sighed beginning to follow which then Sans quietly did after now, as the group went in to see more clearly how much of a carnival this place looked to be but it was much more quiet then one, perhaps too quiet, like it felt abandoned but it wasn’t, it just was a dead quiet, which yet can tell was freaking Mugman out where he went near Brook out of worry which did make Brook a bit worried to, making sure everyone was here seeing Sans not trusting how it was same with Baldi who was studying for any clues of any life in the area. </p>

<p>But the only person who wasn’t bothered was Bendy, almost like he’s used to the dead quiet. “Wow… For a quiet spot here gotta say this place looks grand!” Bendy spoke up which made everyone confusingly look at him for how he was calm by this which he looked back being confused why everyone was confused about his reaction. “It does appear larger than the ones I’ve seen back in my universe” Baldi spoke up, studying the area for any clues it seems, even seeming to walk around checking some spots perhaps for clues of danger or answers to why it’s so quiet. “Well it is said it is one the bestest isles to be! Best carnival, best fair- Hehe you name it really!” Mugman spoke up feeling a bit excited as he walked on checking the area around to seem he is quietly happy there aren't any current threats around. “Are we all even sure this place is safe? There could be anything waiting to strike us.” Sans spoke up, which did make Brook and the rest look to him thinking in some way or considering it to be a high chance, for the rate there encountering dangers it is fair to be unsure of this place being safe after all. “Dammit, you make a fair point- but so far! Nothing has happened!” Bendy spoke up going over to where Sans and Brook stood which then Mugman and Baldi followed after since both haven’t found all that much, though can tell Mugman realized something once Bendy has said that and looks to him worried. </p>

<p>“Uhm… Bendy? We’re in a cartoon world and you could have very well jinxed us for saying that…” Mugman spoke up with a worried look, which Bendy paused and slowly looked to Mugman once learning that fact now with a look of concern that he doomed everybody. Which just like that can hear a COTS roaring from somewhere, almost as if they all were spotted but when everyone looked it was clear it was on this way this other brute like COTS it looks to be, which yet can hear Bendy make a loud enough apology for everyone to hear how he did not mean to jinx them, but yet now is just the focus on escaping this dangerous situation they’re in.  Which Brook was quick to spot one the buildings and quickly began to go to it checking if the rest would follow which seems Sans caught notice first and informed the rest to follow, they all quickly went in hearing the COTS roars only get louder but yet all had gone it and closed the door to what looks like a little performance space within this tent like building, perhaps for one the performers that could’ve been here, but yet as of right now can notice everyone keeping an eye on the window, except Baldi began to study around and Bendy began to do the same due to seeming curious about what’s inside more so versus Baldi who is perhaps checking for any dangers. </p>

<p>Can hear from the outside the roars of this other brute COTS that wandered around in search for anything to destroy which seems it out of anger destroyed a ride not far from it destroying part of a roller coaster with ease clearly, which yet surely means they got lucky to be able to think that much ahead to hide into here. “Well Bendy, this is your fault this happened.” Sans spoke up, looking over to Bendy who looked back to him shocked to hear that which he was about to perhaps argue otherwise but then thought for a second and then reconsidered what he thought just seeming disappointed more so towards himself. “Yeah… I guess I did cause it, Sheesh really gotta consider a lot when it comes to universes huh?” Bendy spoke up, looking to Sans then everyone else, which it’s a good point, they got to consider everything for how a universe could work, rather it being facing conflict rather in a nice or not way, to consider what a universe may give a form for you or even tools to use to help you for the better or for dangerous scenarios, or like this, perhaps meaning anything cartoon like related can happen and surely a lot of fights can surely happen if not careful at the same time. “Ohh.. There has to be some way to go around all of this trouble…” Mugman said with just a worry in his tone, which now gives more ideas to consider here, but just how can they go abouts all of this while taking in the facts of what this universe could very well do? How can they go abouts it all? While the group was searching, it was soon to notice how Baldi stopped at one the further away windows from the door and studied outside of it, which was odd till he spoke up. “Guys, I believe I found this Solgo person, except they aren’t alone.” Which yet got everyone to look over and begin to quickly go over to see what’s outside with Baldi. </p>

<p>Sure enough can see Solgo there, studying out seeing the brute COTS go by which it then noticed Solgo, trying to rush towards to attack before can hear loud enough pass the glass a “STOP” from someone else out there with Solgo, which seems as though they have control over some the COTS to guess. Which yet can see a lady come into view wearing a very black outfit similar to what a nun would wear aside from it having shiraz color on some small parts to match with the hair that covered their face which happened to have weird lines come down from it while they had a smile grow on there face once it seems they looked to Solgo and began to walk over, which while this person was can hear Mugman quickly open one the windows a bit nearby so everyone can hear what is going on now, surely this should get them a lot of info now. “Solgo! Oh there you are, how come you aren’t back at the first area? Didn’t I tell you to take care of everyone there?” This nun girl spoke up as she walked over to Solgo which Solgo looked down quietly almost like she was ashamed or disappointed. “It’s handled…” Solgo mumbled a bit while looking down, which yet caused the group who watched out to look to one another, Solgo was lying since Solgo would’ve attacked them, but the peculiar part was when Solgo lied can see how she looked down seeming to have their head drip a bit more once said that, which says surely something else and that Solgo seems to drip more when lies are said. </p>

<p>“Solgo, Why are you looking all down as you say that? Are you hiding something from me? Come on now, don’t be afraid for I won't hurt you” This nun girl spoke beginning to approach Solgo to where she is, which Solgo seemed to drip a bit more when that last bit was said, it was a lie and that’s why Solgo seemed more unsure of them coming closer. “Solgo now, you know what happens if you don’t obey, you know how everyone says “Oh how strong Solgo is, he can take on anyone that gets in the way, he obeys more than that Stiex fellow and I know you know what he gets for not listening to orders.” Isn’t it correct?” This nun girl went on to try and convince Solgo to listen. It seems just through some sort of trickery, though one can tell Solgo was listening but seems she won’t follow. To notice a detail, is there calling Solgo a he, did Solgo lie to them about them being a her? Or was it just a discovery thing that others don’t know yet? Who knows. But yet can tell Solgo had to try and muster up some words. “...Luradis… Why do we get hurt if we don’t obey?...” Solgo mumbled, looking down at the ground which seems this nun girl known as Luradis studied Solgo upon hearing it, just seeming to get a little annoyed hearing a response like that. “Come on as you know what our boss Storsi does is right after all, you should know this! Plus a little bit of harm can get the messages across more. But enough questioning and how about you start answering what I asked!” Luradis shouted a bit at the end, getting annoyed which Solgo was hesitant but yet there now was a big answer to a lot of stuff, there's a big boss, the big bad in other words here, the name being Storsi. Which can hear Bendy quietly say a “Yes!” Once hearing that they finally got some answers and even found the people that hint in on all of this, which is fair to quietly celebrate but yet course there still is the situation at hands even learning the dangers about some of this, the fact that there is people getting hurt in the group for not listening, which sounds as though that Stiex person is one of them, perhaps the main one but who even knows for sure here for it’s all just theories. “...I understand ma’am…” Solgo mumbled to Luradis which Luradis smiled upon hearing for it did look like they were almost preparing to hurt Solgo if they didn’t answer but Solgo did despite how much it seems Solgo doesn’t wish to but yet Luradis doesn’t happen to see and begins to focus more on something else. </p>

<p>“Good! Good! Now come on how about you go attack and destroy more things to further study your Grand power… Hehehe! Oh the wonders for what else this thing can do!” Luradis laughed as she began to walk a bit away just seeming to be dreaming of whatever Solgos power may be which sure the group briefly may have seen but not the true strengths of it. One thing is for sure; Luradis surely seems to really like power and must be one of those many more helpers like how Balaur and Uvilein are. “We've got to stop them!” Bendy said quietly, able to notice how he quickly moved away rushing to the door to try and go after them but bones summoned right in front of it which Sans went over to him once stopped him even if Bendy tried to move the bones aside to no avail. “Bendy no, we can't just run on into danger, especially if there could be COTS all around here.” Sans spoke up being concerned for Bendys idea on running in. “Well come on! What if this is our one chance? Even then we need to stop them from any more dangers and-” That's when a loud thud was heard from outside interrupting Bendys annoyed speech. While looking at some the windows can see a much larger brute COTS outside approaching over where Luradis was walking away and which seems Solgo quietly followed as if told more so. </p>

<p>Seeing Luradis pet the head of it once this larger brute COTS lowered it but it feels like Luradis must have sinister intentions which makes it noticeable how Solgo wanted to leave. This surely says more which god it’s a wish to get more answers and say something but clearly it isn’t safe which luckily got to thank Sans’s fast reaction to making sure Bendy doesn’t run out because clearly it’s risking a lot. “How could they have gotten ahold of these creatures?...” Mugman quietly asked while looking out the window with Baldi who must be trying to figure it out too. “The best theory to go on is they must’ve had someone make them, hence why they are able to control them.” Baldi answered, looking out trying to find any clues to answers but there wasn’t any. While watching can see Solgo try to go but can suddenly see Luradis act fast pulling a dagger out and throwing it at Solgo which missed but hit into the fence that was behind Solgo, which Solgo was frozen in place not sure what to do upon seeing that. “Now where do you think you're going now, Solgo? Come along back now, we got more business for you to do around here, we don’t want these magnificent creatures to be hurt and doing everything now, do we?” Luradis spoke, who still had a hand on this large brute COTS who had a low growl coming from it towards Solgo more so. </p>

<p>Solgo was frozen in place but slowly had to nod to agree, managing to then take some small steps back over, although it was clear how hesitant she was in doing so. Which Luradis smiled once seeing Solgo do so and looked back at the large brute COTS though seemed to pause and look at the windows the rest looked through which yet Baldi was fast to react to pull everyone down to not be seen which everyone hid low and remained quiet now, god what are the chances of all of these things happening. Which yet can hear steps approaching the windows which just made everyone remain more quiet and slowly move away from the windows slowly the best they can. Till can hear like someone's right at the windows perhaps trying to look in for any clues of anyone, did they hear them somehow? Perhaps get a glimpse of them? Who knows but yet surely can hear how everyone was taking some quiet breathes but can see Bendy hold his and seems to be studying the area for some things getting hold of a box and pulled one the plugs off quietly to use for something as well but who knows what, perhaps it's a plan to get them away, which he quickly poked Sans gesturing to ask for a bone that’s pointed which Sans did summon one once he understood before Bendy took it and began to use it to cut up the box a bit, for the way he’s acting it’s like this triggered some kind of survival instinct. Since everyones watching they all tried to figure some way to help, Mugman moving away further quietly to reach some paint that’s out of sight to slide over while Baldi found what could work for a brush for now to use for the paint which Bendy was quick to use once getting the shaping. </p>

<p>Brook quietly managed to go over further to find some string and brought it over while yet can hear Luradis just seeming to try talking perhaps to see if anyone will respond. “I know someones in there~ Come on out so things don’t get so messy” Luradis had such a dangerous tone and sounded like they must be planning for that large brute COTS to try and break the building. Bendy seemed to quickly get it together adding the string to almost use to pull this creation along, then he hands the object to Mugman to hold as he holds the string, melting into the ground then ends up further away holding onto the string still, then Mugman placed it down which Baldi began to give a countdown as Sans was keeping watch, which Brook studied the situation and made sure it was all staying together the object. Once Baldi finished counting Bendy pulled it along as fast as he could to where he is, making it hit some small things around as it went over as can hear a startled quick scream from outside then annoyance, which once that was done, Sans gave a thumbs up seeing they went away and must’ve gave up on it, the trick worked. “Yes! Survival instincts save the day again! I figured those creature things will work!” Bendy spoke up with joy which yet seems he doesn’t even know the name of it but has seen one. </p>

<p>“You mean a rat?” Brook questioned making sure to keep quiet incase. “That’s what they’re called?” Bendy questioned but yet before more could be questioned and said or there even be time to celebrate, can hear this large rute COTS stomping away like it was mad or went to cause destruction, are those people leaving? They have to follow them; they can’t let them get away.  Which everyone checked out the window to see that Luradis was walking off with this large brute COTS while checking if Solgo is following seeming to be going on about how they should search and hope they can find where the families are hiding around here which getting some idea what’s being discussed made Mugman quickly move away and look to the door worried but determined. “We have to find the families first before they get to them!” Mugman exclaimed, yet everyone looked to him upon hearing that. “We can’t just let that person get away though!” Bendy added on which yet Sans was quick to give some counter to that. “No, the families do make sense first, if they get to them while we’re following can blow their cover, if we get to them now and they figure out the spot the families should be safe first and we’d be ready for them.” Sans went on to explain but Bendy seemed uncertain of it. “But they don’t know where they are, plus if we handle them first then the families would never get hurt to begin with!” </p>

<p>Bendy spoke up, surely uncertain of Sans’s plan which yet really makes everything hard to figure out which to do. “I believe the solution for this is much simpler, some of us keep watch and some of us search for-” “No! Splitting up would be dangerous for anyone who could get hurt!” Mugman interrupted, surely worried about such a thing. “Guys… What if we just follow them for a bit as we search for the spot, then it’s a combo of not losing track and finding them at the same time, then when we find them we can get them to safety and continue to follow since it will still be known where they are?” Brook spoke up now making sure everyone could hear which everyone listened to the speech, which yet nobody had otherwise to say to it, it was a clear and good idea so it should work, which yet it was clear that everyone agreed on it. “Alright then! Let’s go!” Bendy spoke up, quickly going to the door where Sans removed the bones to and quickly everyone began to go out to prepare for this challenge, they should succeed, how would they not? After all they all are working together, all really becoming a team and perhaps even all becoming friends in some way even then, things should go well in the end anyway, right?</p>

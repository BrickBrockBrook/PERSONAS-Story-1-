<h2>Chapter 19. The Problem Ahead</h2>

<p>Within seconds there was all sorts of blackened ropes shooting out which yet can hear a blaster shoot most of them away along with seeing bullets as well along with seeing Bendy charge in towards Solgo dodging each bullet that flew towards, Baldi who was nearby was mainly being a support to help move Mugman around since Mugman wasn’t quick at dodging most the attacks so Baldi helped out with that. Brook stood nearby where Sans was trying to figure some way to help like warning Sans if there was one coming up close or if they needed to move which Sans listened each time during it, at least it’s some form of helping against Solgo who seems they just aren’t themselves for what has been seen of them at least, poor girl just stuck like this, there has to be a way to get her out of it so things can be okay. Till saw Bendy reach Solgo readying to force her down but Solgo quickly got hold of his arm and was the one to throw them down first, which made the ropes stop for a moment which Baldi and Mugman were quick to go in first to try and help Bendy or handle Solgo, Baldi helping Bendy back up and Mugman trying to get to Solgo but Solgo kept pushing Mugman away each time he tried to get close, there has to be a way, which yet Brook then thought of one. </p>

<p>“Sans, summon a bone” Brook asked which Sans looked to Brook and quickly did so, Brook then quickly got hold of it and took aim before throwing it to where Solgo was, hitting Solgo in the arm which gave Mugman a chance to try and get her to the wall, but was quickly thrown away and into Sans due to the blackened rope that shot out, which Bendy charged at Solgo right when but Solgo quickly made quick work too using him to knock Baldi away who got close with. Solgo then charged away once Mugman came towards to try, charging at Sans which Sans was quick to put up a bone wall around him and Brook, seeing Solgo nearly hit into it, but jumps right above it, though as that happened can see a blast shot at Solgo to shoot them away that seems Mugman caused that hit Solgo to the ground nearby the bone wall. “Nice shot!” Brook shouted a bit to give some encouragement which Mugman smiled upon hearing it, before seeing Solgo charge at Mugman which they hit Mugman into the wall, causing Sans to quickly get the bone wall down and quickly summon a bone into his hand to get close and swing at Solgo who tried to attack Mugman with multiple blackened ropes while Mugman tried to charge up another good shot. </p>

<p>The bone hit Solgo causing them to use the blackened ropes as whips to try and hit Sans which he kept dodging during it. Bendy then charged in from behind Solgo hitting them with a punch in the back which made Solgo fall a little but kept their balance, quickly turning around and began to whip at Bendy too who tried to dodge quickly along with but wasn’t as good as Sans was for dodging. Brook was ready to try and go in to help but noticed how Baldi stopped her for a moment, which confused her till Baldi handed one the ropes it seems he managed to somehow chop off that yet still remained which who knows when he did so really maybe it was when multiples of it shot out before, giving one end to Brook as he went opposite of her, perhaps to give an idea for a proper way in attacking, which seems it could very well work. Quickly Brook and Baldi went to where Solgo was, seeing Mugman sneak to a side and was able to sneakily when Solgo was distracted by Sans and Bendy, Mugman pushed them to the general direction to where Baldi and Brook were coming from and which made Solgo fall into it. </p>

<p>Mugman quickly rushed over to get Brook’s end first of it as Baldi went over to hand the other end to Mugman who passed the other two to Baldi and Brook to go around Solgo again who was quickly preparing another attack during it while trying to get free but Bendy rushed over to help make sure Solgo remained stuck as Sans prepared attacks now incase something winds up going wrong. Quickly Baldi, Brook and Mugman got the rope around Solgo wrapped around quite a bit as Bendy was able to let go of Solgo now who struggled to get out, which everyone stepped away in case. “HAHA! That was smart thinking!” Bendy shouted with excitement looking at Baldi, Brook and Mugman, which seems Sans and Bendy weren’t aware of this idea. “I think it was more these two, I just helped out” Brook spoke up while she looked at Mugman and Baldi who looked back and Mugman seemed confused. “It wasn’t really my idea either, that was more Baldi’s part!” Mugman spoke up, smiling to Baldi who seemed to not suspect this much praise for his smart thinking, which guess shows everyones really bonding, but was interrupted when Sans spoke up now. “Guys. I think we should move further away.” Upon Sans saying that, looking to Solgo can tell it seems there powering up a new attack, which everyone began to back up a lot more, Sans making sure to have attacks ready, which everyone else prepared as well, before seeing the rope crumble and break that was wrapped on them seeing them shoot out a lot of ropes to try and attack them, which everyone managed to narrowly dodge, but seems it was beginning to branch out more to try and get to them which yet stinged upon touching. </p>

<p>Bendy seemed to be quick to get the drill, melting into a puddle to try and escape seeing him make his way but came out for a moment being careful to dodge everything as he looked to the rest. “It’s spreading quickly in the ground too, guys!” Bendy spoke up with some worry, this is getting bad.</p>

<h5>Help him out.</h5>

<p>Brook paused upon hearing that echo through her head, how though? Unless… Maybe she can figure some way. “Okay let me try to help.” Brook spoke up while Bendy looked to her, thinking for a moment but quickly sunk down to over to where Brook was, offering a hand out from the puddle he is in nearby where she is. Brook took the offer and was pulled down into the puddle able to kind of see what the area has going on feeling almost like there under water but it really was just what seemed like a blackened puddle around them, which can tell Bendy made sure she held her breathe right away since it appears it must have similar properties to it as well, which Brook did her best to study the area and saw a shine of purple somewhere, which she hinted to Bendy to go that way, which Bendy brought Brook along as they went, finding a more open way to where it was, which Brook kept seeing more hints of it, this has happened before, this thing that’s guiding, that explains it.</p>

<p>Soon both reached in this darkness what looks like seemingly where Solgo was being a clear enough opening to strike, which Bendy quickly got Brook out from one side as can see before one fully gone up he takes the other quickly both each quickly tackling Solgo to go down which retracted the ropes again as they quickly try swinging at the two to attack. Which both managed to move away from quick enough though it did hit Brook a bit, which Solgo began to charge at Brook but Bendy quickly cut in and hit Solgo away to where Sans was shooting bones at Solgo then hitting them away with the bones to where Mugman and Baldi were readying to attack but Solgo quickly hit Baldi down once going over but Mugman shot Solgo off of Baldi when Solgo tried to attack more. Solgo then readied to perhaps to do that attack again once was backed off, but Baldi was quick to go over and hit them back near the wall Solgo was close to so it stops that, everyone then quickly came over to abouts where Solgo was practically backed into now ready-ing more attacks to try and stop them, they got the winning lead here right now, they got to win this. </p>

<p>“Alright, best for you to give up now, otherwise we’ll have to handle you for good.” Baldi spoke up, while everyone stood where Solgo was making sure they can’t escape from any angles. Though as sure they had a confirmed victory here it seems, to notice though Mugman was unsure, which is fair since this is someone they met along this journey who wasn’t at all like this, which yet Mugmans kindness began to shine through even despite this to try and find a different way to stop this. “Solgo… this isn’t how you are!... Come on, we don't have to fight!...” Mugman spoke up trying to get through to Solgo who stared, it’s like they are listening but not, almost like deep down Solgo hears this but yet the way their power is affecting them they can’t fully hear, while at that looking at Solgo whos like this, the situation there in seems to be triggering some kind of small response, like a fear one but it was so settle it’s hard to even notice. But Solgo then suddenly struck quickly tackling Mugman down due to having his guard lowered and quickly escaped further away before having ropes lash out to try and hit anyone they can or grab hold of anyone, which was close to getting Mugman first but Brook quickly got Mugman away from there while just dodging the one that went after her too. </p>

<p>Mugman quickly thanked Brook as he began to shoot at Solgo which Sans was doing the same thing as can see Bendy and Baldi quickly try to make there way over dodging the ropes that tried going after them both, maybe there is a way to get Solgo back to focus though now to think because of before when Mugman talked to them to try and get Solgo to be Solgo. It just needs a matter of planning it right, just may not be the nicest way of doing it. Brook quickly went to Sans who was throwing bones to where Solgo was who was hitting the bones away as can see Mugman has now got Solgo focused on them once Brook got over. “Sans, is it possible for you to somehow make a box around Solgo to trap them in?” Brook asked which Sans nodded but was confused, which he was quick to ask on it. “Why do you need me to do so assuming you need me to do that?” Sans asked which Brook looked over to see if Solgo was readying to attack here or not but can see Mugman had Baldi’s help on keeping Solgo distracted away or more so they were focused on handling Solgo. “When Mugman talked to Solgo, there was a hint of fear perhaps because of us keeping them trapped, as rude as it may be, if we can get Solgo trapped in like some sort of space, it would get Solgo in some way to go to normal, despite it being a bit harsh it’s one emotion that seems its likely to trigger.” Brook explained why she thought this, which Sans understood, it may be harsh but, it’s one way so they don’t all have to physically hurt Solgo badly like how Solgo is trying to towards them. </p>

<p>Solgo then seemed to notice them charging towards but can see Bendy quickly hit them aside as he looked to Brook and Sans giving a smile and thumbs up before he focuses again to handle Solgo too, which means they should say the plan to the rest or give the message somehow, which Sans was already quickly figuring some way to get the bones ready as Brook now quickly went to Baldi who was nearby to see if she could tell him on the plan here. But Solgo quickly hit Brook into the ground readying to hit Brook with the ropes but can see Sans and Mugman shoot Solgo off quickly which Solgo did then when tried coming back Bendy bodychecked Solgo away to prevent more from going on causing Solgo to focus on Bendy due to it trying to attack him, giving Brook a chance to get back up and get to Baldi who was about to go in to help out the best he can. “Baldi, Told the plan to Sans already, but we need to find some way to get Solgo trapped in a box Sans is going to try and do with his bones at least since it seems to cause some form of reaction upon being trapped which may be one the best ways to stop Solgo from being in this form.” Brook quickly explained which Baldi listened in and quickly understood, studying the area and making sure they both aren’t being targeted currently before Baldi looked to Brook seeming to have figured something. </p>

<p>Can see Baldi quickly make his way to Mugman which Brook was about to follow before seeing Solgo nearly hit into her but Brook just dodged it as Solgo began to try and whip the ropes at Brook seeing one even seeming to try and get the necklace but can see Bendy quickly get in between it hitting the ropes away despite can tell it stinged him but clearly he was healing himself during it for how there was the ink bubbling on his hands a bit during it. “STOP. TRYING. TO. ATTACK. US!” Bendy shouted as he kept Solgo back, who was trying to attack him but Bendy dodged each one going to where Brook was guarding her from anything that could happen, which gives Brook a chance to say the plan. “You don’t have to worry too long, Bendy, we got a plan to stop this, Sans is already preparing it, just need to get Solgo into a position to trap them in it, it may be the one way to handle this.” Brook spoke up, giving the hint of the plan which Bendy listened in nodding then smiling, before suddenly both of them got knocked down, seeing Bendy quickly get thrown into the wall which Bendy quickly charged at Solgo due to it trying to try and attack more but Solgo threw him back there. Brook quickly got up seeing this, quickly going over and when Solgo wasn’t focused on her and was more focused on Bendy she quickly tried to hit Solgo down or aside as hard as she could. </p>

<p>Solgo backed off and fell a bit but quickly caught themselves, readying to quickly handle Brook but Bendy charged next at Solgo hitting them into the wall he was hit into, then he looked to Brook giving a thumbs up to her for helping out. Quickly can see Mugman began to shoot at Solgo which Solgo quickly began to have ropes go after both Bendy and Mugman but Bendy was quick to dodging them and began to charge towards Solgo again as Mugman quickly dodged it and began to shoot at Solgo perhaps to hopefully distract them, while that went on Brook studied the area around for a good spot to keep them trapped, till they caught a good spot that could work, going to it as she signaled a bit to where Bendy was when he was about to get to Solgo getting the message quickly on what’s the idea here. Solgo noticed Bendy before he could land an attack and threw him into the wall preparing another rope to attack him with but can see Baldi threw a piece of the rubble at Solgo’s head to stop them, which Solgo looked to Baldi before Mugman quickly got Bendy out from that situation and began to go over to where Brook was while Mugman shot at Solgo some more. </p>

<p>Solgo began to charge at to where Mugman was upon being hit as Baldi went over to Sans who seems to be ready now for this seeing Sans go over to ready it into position which Baldi seems to be doing the math to be sure it will work correctly. Once Solgo was close enough, Bendy got Mugman and Brook leaded the way to move aside quickly as Solgo was about to charge right into them all but missed hitting into the wall that was there then quickly can see blue bones go up trapping Solgo within that area in a small box of sorts making it incapable of Solgo escaping. Bendy put Mugman down upon seeing this happen and knowing it’s safe now as Brook looked at Sans and Baldi which can see Baldi and Sans look to one another giving each other a small smile, it seems they worked together to be sure it worked correctly and accurately. Can see Solgo quickly try to escape and hit the bones out of the way with their ropes but it seems it hurts each time they tried making them back away from it though can see some hints of reaction to it, it should be working now. “Solgo… We don’t have to keep fighting here… Calm down and we will stop what is going on the best we can, okay?” Mugman spoke up, moving a bit over to the bones but not to close incase of a plotted attack does happen by chance. </p>

<p>Solgo tried to go after Mugman but the bones knocked them back and made them back away more, they should listen eventually at this rate. “Listen to Mugman Solgo! Look, you helped us so we will help you! That is how it has always worked!” Bendy supported Mugman with this which did seem to kind of cause a wave of trying to get through to Solgo now. “They do make fair points you know” Baldi joined in a little which got Sans to do so as well. “Yeah, even if it’s clear you don’t want to do this to begin with.” Sans spoke up which Brook tried to be the final bit of encouragement now for Solgo to hopefully go back to normal. “Everyone here is right, Solgo you're strong here, you can break out from it no matter the situation, we’re all here to help the best we can to be sure you’ll be free, okay?” Brook spoke up while everyone watched Solgo now who was sitting still as this went on, does seem they were listening, kind of like hopefully something is happening to get Solgo back to normal. Everyone waited for something, anything from Solg here to figure what is there to do but so far nothing, though everyone patiently waited despite this, all hoping for a good result. Till can see some the darkness on Solgo slowly in small pieces float off bit by bit, able to see more of a reaction during this as it went on, seeing although they seemed scared due to being trapped like this it seems but can tell there was something hopeful like they’re trying to break free from this themselves. </p>

<p>Upon seeing, Can see Mugman get excited and same with Bendy but can tell Sans and Baldi kept calm though can tell both are a bit excited too for how they’re watching this, which Brook watched with a mixed reaction for she is getting excited to but kept it calm and under control so it doesn’t mess with anything, thank goodness this is working. Once it reached a point where it was mostly gone, Sans slowly lowered the bones so it didn't cause any more stress afterwards, which made Mugman go over quickly and check if Solgo is calming down, Bendy then followed after quickly to help out incase as well. “You feeling better, Solgo??” “Do we have to try and do something again to stop this behavior or not?” Bendy asked along with Mugman as they checked Solgo who was trying to calm down but looked to them and then the rest in the room and can see some hint of relief now for them but also just an apologetic look as they looked to everyone. “Sorry everyone… I… I Couldn’t…” “It’s okay. Considering what happened was quite clear that it was out of your control.” Baldi interrupted to make it clear to Solgo already everyone understands which yet Sans added on for what he figured of that whole moment. </p>

<p>“It was clear whatever that lady did was trigger a power outburst to put you in a state with no control, never the safest thing to even try and do if you ask me.” Sans explained which everyone listened to, which seems Bendys had his sudden thoughts too. “So that machinery must’ve done some kind of shock somewhere where the power is stored to cause it to activate, which means they could’ve implemented something somewhere on you to trigger such a thing even from that distance!” Bendy explained looking to Solgo to see if they know any spots this could be the case. Solgo looked at him with a look unknowing where it could be, then looked around to the rest and then the area a bit before looking to the exit. “It doesn’t matter now… Luradis… That lady… They will be escaping to the furthest spot to search for materials to help fuel the portals so this universe can be in serious danger…” Solgo explained a different fact perhaps to let it settle now for what’s happened before which everyone looked to one another considering that into thought, surely Solgo seems to know about this sort of thing. “Well that’s where we’ll be headed!” Bendy shouted which everyone agreed on really quickly but yet can notice Mugman studied Solgo seeing Solgo looks tired and hurt. </p>

<p>“What about you? Are you going to be okay here?” Mugman asked which Solgo looked back thinking for a moment and figured some answer. “I’ll be fine… I think maybe a friend will be coming around anyway to help out…” Solgo answered that although everyone was confused, Brook thought and remembered when they got here a certain someone was searching for another that could be Solgo, which yet Brook felt reassured knowing they will be okay then just got to hope they’ll be found here. “Well then that means we gotta get going to find this person and defeat them!” Bendy exclaimed which everyone agreed with and yet Bendy began to right away get going to the way out from here, Mugman ready to follow but waved bye to Solgo first before doing so, which Baldi began to follow them then Sans and Brook was going to go but stopped to look at Solgo and check on them. “Solgo… We really hope you'll be okay… Just know that we will help the best we can, we kinda did with others like you after all…” Brook spoke up while Solgo listened in, seeming to understand quickly what Brook meant and gave a small smile. “Thank you… please do try and… save all of us from this… there’s many of us that never wanted to be part of any of this but… …Please, if anything happens though to one of my friends, do everything you can to help him too.” Solgo went on to say almost a bit more info about this, so many of them got forced into this? How long as it been going on for since judging Solgos expressions, it looks like it’s gone on for a long time. Brook nodded her head and then could hear a “You coming Brook?” from what seems to be Sans who noticed Brook hasn’t caught up yet which Brook nodded and waved bye to Solgo and began to follow now as both Sans and Brook caught up with the rest while Solgo watched as they went. </p>

<p>The group went onward quickly out from the place that yet left hopes the people further into there are actually okay which is likely they are and are staying low back further in but yet there was no time to check due to everybody rushing out to try and get to that place, Mugman telling which way to go since he is the most familiar with this universe after all since it’s where he lives here. The group rushed over but soon saw Bendy stop causing Mugman to and then the rest as well seeing ahead what seems like the next way into the isle but it’s currently blocked off by one of those brute like COTS which as Bendy was seeming to ready to find something to hit it with can see some flying COTS fly over to it as well perhaps being some form of a sky patrol to, surely that must mean that Luradis is up head in that next area but yet this is a whole situation. “Any ideas?” Bendy turned to look at everyone for some idea which everyone began to think now on if there's anything that can handle this. “Maybe we could sneak around?” Mugman brought up some sort of idea but yet it doesn’t seem for sure it would work by chance at least in this but it’s always good to throw in ideas. </p>

<p>“Would make sense if we can handle those flying COTS first then the brute makes it so it could be somewhat an easier battle.” Sans brought up somewhat an idea of his which is a fair one to go for. “Won’t be easy to do, one COTS is by the brute and another is in the sky near where we are, one sudden move and it will cause everyone to notice where we are no matter how much time there could be possible to do any move.” Baldi spoke up seeing how he was studying what was going on from around like usual to usually figure the best times to do anything or what could work best in some situations. “Then we might just have to brute force it ourselves!” Bendy spoke up which he was about to go but quickly Brook and Sans stopped him from running in to try and do that. “Bendy it’s never safe or a good idea to just go in and brute force things” Sans spoke up which Brook quietly agreed with which Bendy let out a sigh and knew a plan had to be figured out to get past this obstacle. Brook studied some spots and tried to figure ideas which seems everyone else was to now hearing some ideas brought up but none seem to be as good to work. There has to be some kind of way, which as she studied spots she winded up looking to one out of curiosity from nearby the brute. </p>

<h5>There’s always a hidden away deep down…</h5>

<p>That voice echoed through her head again but she's kind of been getting used to it due to this journey it felt it’s just been guiding her here. In fact she has an idea now due to it. “We can go from underneath, Bendy can get all of us there just by sinking downwards one by one, even then with that we can even attack the brute from behind who may prevent any of those flying COTS from coming in anyways.” Brook brought up to the rest who looked at her and everyone thought for a moment and realized it could very well work, it has to after all. As the group agreed though, that’s when a sudden sound of something flying right by them was heard and sounded of it crashing into the ground which checking was a flying COTS hit into the ground causing rubble around there, which the brute COTS readied and can see more flying COTS come around to where and seeing them charge at something too. But quickly saw a flash of a maroon hit them all away and can see someone stand in front of the brute COTS who roared into this person's face that yet was quickly familiar to the majority of the group aside from Baldi who was confused by this. Can see the brute COTs try and swing at the person rapidly but can see this familiar person dodge quickly seeing them in different spots having some sort of maroon glow before seeing how quick they made work of this brute COTs having quickly tackled it to the ground and destroyed it into pieces with some kind of weapon they had at hand that can see changed into some sort of form of a pitch fork or trident by chance but then break and go into pieces and go to where this maroon person was seeming to get hold of those pieces and putting them back somewhere. </p>

<p>But Brook noticed how there was a flying COTS that was sneakily coming towards Stiex to attack when he wasn’t looking which can see Bendy react quickly to as well, grabbing one the pieces of rubble that was close by and threw it at the flying COTS knocking it far away which Bendy shouted at it watching it go down. “HAH! GOT’CHA DAMM FLYING COTS!” Bendy surely seemed happy to get it but then slowly came the realization of one thing, the person can see him, revealing their spot and checking now to the person, yeah he’s directly looking over, it confirms truly who this is now, it’s Stiex.</p>

<h5>Being stuck in your mind having no control of what you do is a strange thing.</h5>
<h5>You do things you as a person would never do.</h5>
<h5>Could  what you become kill the ones you love?</h5>
<h5>Or make people lose the ones they care for?</h5>

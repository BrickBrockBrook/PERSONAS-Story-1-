<h2>Chapter 13. Windy Fight</h2>

<p>“FOR THE SEVENTH TIME WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE’RE ‘LOVE BIRDS’???” Bendy shouted, just closer to Uvilein just annoyed and confused by what Uvilein is refusing to explain. “Oh come on! Everyone knows what that is as said! You and Her clearly are close and perhaps could like one another that way so what better terms would it be if not to call you such a thing?” Uvilein explained but Bendy still seemed all so lost for what he could possibly even mean by all of this clearly. “Well we aren’t that Uvilein, I barely know the guy that much at that, We don’t see one another that way.” Brook spoke up, just at least being the one to explain that they aren’t that, why would they be that? It seems kind of weird at that, even when she barely knows him or is that close with him. “Alright then! If you say so, But I wouldn’t be surprised if that changes!” Uvilein spoke, looking away from them and going ahead as Brook and Bendy just kind of sighed in annoyance even though they both are annoyed for different reasons, but yet kept going onward throughout this whole walk. </p>

<p>As they walked it seems they neared what seems like a darker dangerous like spot within this forest, showing more older trees that some looked like it couldn’t grow any more of those red leafs from before and the ground looked older for it was a more darker purple and even seemed more wet the ground since it made a slush like sound for some the steps they took, odd and yet dark, but it wasn’t so scary since at least none of them are alone in this place, but weird how Uvilein made them go this way. “Say… Are any of you perhaps afraid of insects?” Uvilein spoke up, glazing at everyone with a grin like smile on his face. “I-Insects?? Oh no, those are scary! I remember one time a spider got in my bed and it was scary! But one of my brothers did handle it…” Mugman exclaimed with a worried tone in his voice looking at some of the rest in worry. “Don’t worry! Insects aren’t that bad! I won’t let any hurt any of us anyways!” “Even large centipedes?” Uvilein asked Bendy who was exclaiming to protect them but yet slowly looked to Uvilein confused by what he meant by large centipedes. </p>

<p>“Ohhh noooo…” Mugman stuttered, going over closer to where Brook was in fear and worry which Brook carefully helped relax Mugman from it even despite being worried about it too. “HAHAHA! Oh don’t worry, don't worry! I was only messing with you! I had some ways of handling most of them anyway!” Uvilein laughed as he kept leading the way onward which only somewhat helped since they only said most of them, what about the rest though? Surely leaves it still worrisome. “Oh how ‘reassuring’ to say!” Bendy annoyingly said in response to what Uvilein had said, just able to tell he’s annoyed by him clearly, which cannot blame him for one bit, at least it is nice he is trying to defend everyone. “What else is out here aside from that?” Sans spoke up now after being mostly silent during this, but can tell he was studying around keeping watch incase of danger. “Oh there's many things here, Spiders, Wolves, Insane Jesters, Spronklers, Jurimpers, you get the idea!” Uvilein explained while not being threatened by this, Sans just listened in quietly then looked around the area perhaps to keep an eye out for that now as they got closer to the place Uvilein mentioned. </p>

<p>“Ah, helpful.” “Oh wait not really I forgot all those insane jesters killed one another a while ago! Heard that from one the ones that came running to me on needing some help!” Uvilein added that Sans looked to him confused a bit but focused on making sure the area is safe now once again. “Uhm… why would you be all the way out here sir?...” “Because nobody would come out here to interrupt my time inventing now! You have to be brave and so willing if you want to come this way, which you guys are now, right?.” Uvilein turned and looked at Mugman with a smile that seemed to scare Mugman a bit more but tried to put on a brave look despite it all. “Hey, is that the place up ahead?” Brook spoke up now, gesturing to what’s ahead of them in which Uvilein turned to look and had a bigger smile on his face and went more over to where Brook is. “Oh ho ho! No but close! That would be the very place where we will have to go through though to get to it! That is Decesive, a house like appearing creature that’s a cave, just don’t scream loudly in there though or you’d be dinner!” Uvilein laughed a bit but yet focused again, looking at Brook with a smile. “Though you should be careful in there now missy! Don’t want you screaming so best to go through with your eyes closed and ears plugged!” “But I don’t scream?” Brook added, being confused by why Uvilein suggested all of that just managing to back away more from him. “Well! Even better! Anyone else here then who does? Like you little croissant?” “I’M NOT A CROISSANT!” Bendy shouted at Uvileins comment which yet Uvilein just seemed entertained by his reaction as Uvilein focused on the rest now like they already got an answer that yet just left Bendy annoyed. </p>

<p>“Uhm… can’t we just go around it?” Mugman murmured, looking to the fake house that’s ahead worried about it. “Well we can but that means we’d have to go encountering this large dangerous flying COTS with its army of small ones that eat any prey piece by piece! We don’t want that now do we?” “WE CAN TAKE IT! WE HAD TO FIGHT A COTS AS TALL AS A HOUSE! WE CAN TAKE IT!” Bendy shouted, looking at Uvilein with a small bit of a glare in which Uvilein just smiled despite seeing such a look now. “Alright! Then best get ready for combat if you so insist, but if any of you are scared, how about I take you through the cave like creature, Perhaps you would?” Uvilein looked quickly to Brook with a smile that felt odd to her, which although sure it could be safer but she doesn’t trust him bonus she just wishes to be with the rest and help out too with such foes as she has failed to before because of Balaur being a whole scenario. “No, thank you… I’m not worried about dealing with a COTS since it’s been done before on handling one…” Brook answered Uvileins request just moving more back to where Bendy is since Bendy would be able to understand why and would help if they try to convince otherwise to this choice. </p>

<p>“Ah! A brave girl I see! Oh how great! But if you do wish to go through now that could be done since- ""If she said she wants to stick with us she’s going to stick with us!” Bendy interrupted, just already guarding Brook in some way in which Uvilein only smiled at as he continued the way onward going around the creature carefully which the rest followed suit making sure to be careful as well as thinking they could all risk disturbing it, which everyone then easily got by such a thing and carried onward, heading onward a more darker path that was ahead which yet was scary causing Mugman to move closer to where Brook was which Brook made sure Mugman was able to feel safe as she tried to keep watch same as the other two but it’s odd since Uvilein didn’t seem cautious or scared even, odd like always, surely seems the point Bendy made just seems more and more possible by the second, just got to be ready for anything that could happen if so then. </p>

<p>The group continued walking on and yet can notice how Bendy had more of a suspicion look during each step of the way like he was having time to think about all of this and even what’s happened that made him move more with caution which caused the rest to move that way to thinking otherwise, but Brook had the idea perhaps it also could be a danger being around Uvilein, perhaps something bad could happen maybe any second, luckily so far no signs of danger, but that changed quickly once Mugman spoke up in a panic. “UH- g-guys?? What’s ahead of us?...” Mugman shakely said, gesturing ahead to this almost blob of darkness that it's hard to figure what exactly it is, causing Sans to summon a blaster incase if this is dangerous to have ready. “Don’t know, it’s hard to make out what it is from this far though…” Sans answered, just trying to study it the best he can like how everyone else was except Brook who made out what it was quickly. </p>
<p>“Those are COTS… They’re all gathered up together attacking something but it’s hard to tell what…” Brook spoke up, just seeming to try and get ready herself the best she could. “Wow! Grand observation now! Those are the very COTS messing with my things! In which it seems they messed with a lot, In which seems to prove I wasn’t lying now right?” Uvilein spoke but looked to Bendy with a somewhat look of annoyance as he kept on smiling which made Bendy just give a bit of a glare back, still being too suspicious of all of this. “GUYS!” Mugman shouted suddenly, seeming to quickly go over in front to push Brook, Bendy and Uvilein aside due to a COTS lunging at them as Sans got his blaster to blast that COTS gone once Mugman got everyone to move aside. “Are you okay?” “Yeah, good save there though.” Brook answered Mugmans question in which Mugman smiled upon hearing it as got ready to fight now since it seems it caused all of the other COTS to react now. “Oh you all are such heroes! Now please please if you feel too scared or weak of this danger though come to me and I can show off my other invention that shall heal you all up!” Uvilein smiled at the rest but mostly looked to Brook like they suspected Brook to go down first, which wasn’t reassuring but Bendy did glare right at him during that before focusing ahead again now to ready for this large fight. </p>

<p>Suddenly fast a COTS came charging at Brook which Bendy quickly charged right back at it knocking it aside, till another one came charging but Brook quickly smacked it with her jacket causing it to be distracted for a second then Bendy quickly handled it from there for that one. Then another came charging towards which Mugman quickly stepped in to shoot at it where with his magic bullets that came from his hand, just struggling to dodge each attack but Brook quickly helped Mugman out in dodging each one till it got handled as one that tried to sneak attack got blasted by Sans quickly. Which yet more and more kept on coming at them and yet at times Brook checked how everyone was while dodging COTS but noticed how Uvilein wasn’t fighting, but seeming to be turned out looking like he’s working on something, or maybe they aren’t secretly, it was hard to tell, but yet before one could further study got tackled down by a COTS which she struggled and tried to get free from that no. </p>

<p>She quickly looked to see if the rest would come while trying to make the COTS back off, till can quickly see the COTS was hit right off by a hammer that went by fast, a familiar one at that, but- It can’t be him, right? Which yet one looked to where seeing in the shadows that Alovo was there, giving a shush gesture before quickly hurrying away while still having that same look he always has, now that says a lot. Which yet quickly makes Brook now get up to go quickly heading to the rest to help but hopefully hint what’s going on, but had a flying COTS quickly land in front of her before trying to slash at her with its wings. Which Brook quickly backed away from while getting her jacket off and ready to then throw at the COTS face and then get the pencil to stab it into it’s head to take care of it. “NICE ONE!” Can hear Bendy shout from nearby, quickly handling two COTS from where he was, then seemed to notice something by Brook which yet he quickly came over and handled the COTS that was charging at her, which Brook thanked him for before looking around making sure to be ready. “Hey Bendy, it’s not just us fighting here you know…” Brook whispered to him which made Bendy quickly look at Brook now.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, ‘not just us?’ Brook? Is Uvilein finally doing something and not just standing around?” Bendy whispered back, quickly handling two COTS by hitting the two COTS heads together. “Well, it’s more so Alovo who's here too…” Brook whispered, quickly dodging a COTS watching Bendy punch it down into the ground now as he looked at Brook again. “Well great this is like the Balaur thing almost all over again, except odd how he hasn’t done anything yet though but hey you're still here so it’s okay-” but as Bendy was saying that a loud animal like screech was heard from behind them, which yet both of them now slowly looked up to. Just not far from them can see the giant winged COTS from way before, looking right down at the group with a group of winged COTS flying around it, surely it was clear though that this COTS was not happy, not in the slightest for it screeched loudly again as to cause the group to start charging at them fast which yet can see a blaster was fastly summoned in front of them so a lot of the flying COTS just ram into that so Brook and Bendy quickly got out of there fast now. Though they can hear the large flying COTS screech again causing the group of flying COTS to change direction so they won’t ram into the blaster and begin to chase after the rest now, causing them to all quickly try to run far to be ready for that. “Told you there was a dangerous flying COTS now! Believe me now?” “NOW'S NOT THE TIME FOR CHIT CHATTING!” Bendy shouted at Uvilein quickly going by him as quickly tried to ready for a part of the group of flying COTS to come at him now clearly readying to hit each one. </p>

<p>“Well guess I won’t be helping you with all of those then that as said they will eat any prey piece by piece!” Uvilein spoke up, which Bendy glared a bit at Uvilein before suddenly just all the flying COTS tackled Bendy down to the ground and started to attack parts of him to try and eat which made Bendy struggle but then melt into the ground to pop out from behind some to quickly handle them all now, throwing one past Uvilein who only smiled, then looked away elsewhere to where Brook was. Brook was quickly just dodging each one sticking by Mugman who shot at each one the best he can while Brook helped Mugman dodge any attacks that was difficult for Mugman to do, till some came charging at them from multiple angles which yet surely felt it just got real difficult, yeah need a plan fast. “Wait- Brook high five me real quick?” “Huh? Okay?” Brook was confused why Mugman wanted to but did so quickly, which once that was done Mugman quickly seemed to ready himself now, gesturing for Brook to pick him up in a second till seems he quickly jumped into the air and spun around causing a large blast of the this magic attack to come shooting out in mostly one direction which Brook got hold of him then to aim for all around them fast so it gets each one as Mugman finished that up just managing to get out from that and smiled at Brook for that, creative idea surely. </p>

<p>“Nice one!” Brook spoke up, while quickly readying to help handle more COTS around, which Mugman smiled some more hearing as he shot those magic bullets at any further away COTS fast. Which yet when Brook was readying to help any COTS that got closer, felt quickly lifted up from behind her from where her jacket was and began to go high up and once at a quite high height Brook checked around her carefully to see behind her the large flying COTS having picked her up by the jacket from it’s mouth and seems to be readying to fly. Brook though quickly reacted fast just managing to slide out from her hood and fall down, which can see the large flying COTS drop the jacket out to try and catch her but can see a blaster zoom by catching Brook first with it’s mouth on Brooks top a bit, which Brook took a moment to handle that rush but then quickly got onto the back of it as the blaster quickly zoomed to the ground again but the flying COTS quickly went after them in hopes to try and get Brook again. In which once got to the ground Brook hopped off and quickly looked to the big flying COTS speeding to grab but can then see the blaster shoot right at it fast holding that large beam of the blast at its face so it backs off fast now, which gave Brook a chance to get her jacket and quickly get to the other side of the big flying COTS so it won’t notice for where she is currently, while checking for everyone else around to see how they all are. </p>

<p>Which yet can see everyone fighting hard during all of it but yet an open path all the way to Uvilein, unharmed and not fighting but seeming to have some kind of machinery ready, seeming to take aim but seemingly right towards Brook, what did he think he was doing? Unless it was to get the big flying COTS in front of her that yet hasn’t seen her but- the look on his face it felt it said otherwise, surely a lot of no good. But she reacted fast waiting for a moment till saw Uvilein then shoot it out and she quickly went more behind the large flying COTS feet as the attack shot out a large net that yet missed her but managed to react in a specific way to go around one the feet that luckily she wasn’t there for and can tell he pulled on it to cause the large flying COTS react in screeches trying to fly so it won’t fall but it struggled to get free, making it work for an open attack, but something about that wasn’t right, no something was off, but what? She surely can’t figure that out, but yet she quickly moved away now and quickly over near where the rest were to help them all out fast, even if it felt Uvilein was still watching her. “HEY WATCH WHERE YOU AIM THAT! YOU ALMOST GOT SOME OF US HERE!” Bendy shouted while throwing a COTS past Uvilein as he focuses on the large flying COTS since it’s trapped now. “Well next time listen when I said ten seconds ago I was going to launch this after those ten seconds.” </p>

<p>“You didn’t say anything?” Sans ended up adding in to this conversation while blasting away some COTS as he looked at Uvilein with some confusion on his face but a serious look, maybe even suspicion, which yet Uvielin only smiled being unintimidated. “Ohh could be because you guys were busy fighting, no judgment for that.” Uvilein spoke up as he held the machine in place while the big flying COTS tried to get free from the net which was close to, leaving it for not much more time for chit chat but more so to focus on attacking the COTS now. Sans then quickly went to it and summoned a blaster to shoot at it, Bendy running beside, quickly jumping onto it and got it to move forward which Sans was surprised by it seemed trying to summon another during this while Bendy quickly made the blaster go up higher and closer to the big flying COTS to shoot more into it at weaker spots, which got Sans to follow suit in shooting blasters at those spots as the big flying COTS tried swatting some the blasters away and attacking the best it can or escape the net stuck on it’s foot to the best of it’s abilities which was succeeding to some degree surely. </p>

<p>Soon it broke free fast and began to hit each blaster away and fly high up preparing to do a high hitting attack from above which everyone looked up to see, crap and nobody here could really aim that high aside from to guess Mugman and Sans since they can shoot, unless Uvilein can but to figure Uvilein hasn’t done too much it seems aside from that one thing. “DAMMIT! OKAY DOES ANYONE GOT IDEAS FOR THAT??” Bendy shouted as he made the blaster head back to the ground and got off it quickly as he looked to the rest for ideas on this matter. “Wh-What if we can’t stop it and we struggle to dodge it??” Mugman worried, looking up to it in worry and some fear even, which made everyone else look to one another in worry except Sans seemed to have more of a serious look on his face, an idea it even seems. “Alright, everyone step aside.” Sans spoke up in a serious tone, which everyone looked to him as he moved more towards to where abouts the center would be, which made everyone look to him worried, Bendy though seemed more so concerned going quickly to him once Sans stood in the middle. </p>

<p>“ARE YOU CRAZY!?? NO! YOUR NOT DOING THAT ALONE! YOU COULD RISK DYING IF YOU DO OR HURTING YOURSELF!” Bendy shouted with concern in his voice, which made Sans look at Bendy while can tell he was preparing something for how he got his hand out and it glowed with a blue of sorts. Sans though didn’t really say anything just looked to Bendy then a bit to the side like he has some sort of other answer to this reaction but he didn’t say it, almost like a look of regrets for it, which Bendy noticed and looked more worried at him then concerned, as Sans looked up again readying the attack still. “Sans… Bendys right. This isn’t safe to try alone. Look let’s just move and-” but before Brook can say more can see the large flying COTS begin to charge down fast at everyone, which made some of the rest move but Bendy stayed where Sans stood since both haven’t moved yet, Sans then raising his hand high as can see how his eyes surely did change to just have one be pitch black and the other seemingly be this blue color of sorts with a bit of yellow before can see multiples of the blasters summon all around where Sans and Bendy stood facing up to the COTS and shooting right up at it causing this large blast, which can tell was draining Sans for it, which made Bendy quickly try to figure some way to help with that, just quickly getting any of those candies off from the tree as learnt before and quickly brought some to Sans handing one to him but seems Sans didn’t notice which Bendy basically forced it into his face to make him take it even if it surprised him did help him get some more magic again, it was working and yet was seeming to destroy the big flying COTS bit by bit which made it clear there getting somewhere and must be winning despite everything, perfect. Whilst this went on, Brook and Mugman managed to quickly during this get any further away candies from the trees working together to reach them and made a pile so that way Bendy can have an easy way to quickly grab some back and forth, Mugman seeming to have some as well perhaps to soon help out with it better so it’s not so tough for just Sans now. </p>

<p>Once Brook got to one the trees trying to reach one the further away ones can feel she felt someone touch her shoulder, which made her look in curiosity seeing it was Uvilein who had some kind of smile on his face, surely seemingly though not a good one it felt. “Do you… have a better idea on this?” Brook asked quietly, to which Uvilein only smiled more. “You can say it is.” Uvilein only just smiled while looking at her in what felt a bad way. Till suddenly quickly felt hit and trapped right into this net that Uvilein must’ve shot at Brook which made Brook quickly struggle and quickly yell out “HELP!” to the rest. This caused Mugman to have noticed before the rest since he was closer, shouting “BROOK!” Back before Uvilein laughed at this attempt to ask for help. “HAVE FUN BEING BAMBOOZLED FOOLS!”Uvilein shouted before quickly turned, turning on another piece of machinery that went onto his feet to suddenly quickly rolled fast far away from everyone while having a piece of machinery carry the net Brook was stuck in along, causing Brook to call to the rest for help again which only saw some begin to look as the large flying COTS has become nothing but shadows fading around them as Sans looked and collapsed, till they were too far to see anymore but just leave a hope someone will come and help. </p>

<h5>What’s it like to cry for help?</h5>
<h5>I wouldn’t ever know how that is, After all I only seen it</h5>
<h5>But the choice to help or cause more cries?</h5>
<h5>It truly is an unknown decision to make…</h5>

<h2>Chapter 1. The calling.</h2>


<h5>An extraordinary day… </h5>
<h5>So extraordinary…</h5>
<p>Look around now, every universe, all a peaceful life, every story, every life, look at all those emotions they feel, everyones, a painted picture for everyone,  those faces, those feelings. How pathetic the thought of such emotions as one thought. </p>
<h5>What if we changed it?</h5>
<p>Is what one can think, destruction, the perfect day for it, the many people out there, the many universes one can bestow upon, the day to destroy everything and make it work upon in their favor, the day is here, who is to stop them?</p>
<h5>Remember it</h5>
<p>A thing that has echoed through one's mind even in their dreams, a thought that won't ever flee from within their mind, the best ways to get it out is on paper, draw it, take a moment to breath and calm down.</p>
<h5>ReMeMbEr…</h5>
<p>It echoes, it continues to echo the things heard in a dream, the twisted story, draw it off, draw it away. Finally, it’s relaxing now, the memory of a dream faded, all one can see is a little toon one had drawn looking back with a calm smile, you’re safe now, you’re at home, well, for what one can call home that is, not at that dream world that one wishes there will be answers to it someday.</p>

<p>Today, was yet a normal day for one, normal day in their world, a bright summer day with a nice gentle breeze to cool you off from the summers heat, able to hear those birds chirping from outside and the breeze rustle the leafs in the trees around, the smell of what could be grass freshly cut or the smell of something floral for the flowers planted around, but yet one remains inside, drawing to her heart's content of little characters she can come up with all drawn in pencil. She didn’t have much to do today, everything has been finished up and done so now is the time to relax, imagine things, imagine a world full of- oh what can work? Right! A world of many beings in a toon like world! That can do! When she began to draw it, well, she stopped, thinking for a moment. </p>

<p>Would that idea be too beyond? Maybe already done before, but she isn’t sure it has been, so she sat back thinking, glancing abouts the room a bit to help her think, looking at the pastel purple walls of this room, neatly made bed not far, desk often taken care of from any artworks made, along with photos hung up of her and her brother along with the rest of her family. Which to think they all went out for today, so what’s there to do about that? She will be alone for a few hours after all, maybe she should make something to eat? Get a drink? Yeah that can do! Can’t draw on an empty stomach now. She then got up quickly, a smile on her face as she went out the room and onwards to the kitchen, checking the food that they got or any supplies they may have to make some food, they’re is yet several options one could choose from truly, what is there for her to choose? Till saw an yet easy route, could make some cookies, can be a nice small batch that even when the rest do get back some day soon they all can enjoy it, so began to get right to work on that. </p>

<p>It’s simple right? Able to get it done in no time! Even for- do you remember?. No. Why wont that thought go away? She then mumbled to herself “Focus here Brook.” before then got to work again on the cookies. Soon she was done with them in no time! All baked and now got to cool down, which means during this she can get a drink. She checked around to see what can work for a drink till suddenly a loud crash was heard, which stopped Brook for where she stood, startled by it but grew curious to what it was, checking around to where she heard it, hearing it near her room, which when checked it was nothing. Till she saw a glimpse of outside, going to her window and seeing something… unbelievable. Someone presumably covered in a fur or quills to say was on the ground face first, seeming a part of this beings body, which when checking can see a portal to assume it being far above for where this being must’ve came from, which caused a rush of worry, but more of a different kind, not for what kind of being is there, but a more rush of worry for if they’re hurt, so she rushed to get her shoes on, then rushed outside going to where this now closer inspection quilly being laid upon. </p>

<p>Brook rolled this being over carefully to see someone who appeared uncautious and must’ve passed out from the fall, so she tried with the strength she could to pick them up carefully even if these quills pricked a bit and felt odd she managed and managed to carry this fellow inside, laying them down on the couch to let this being relax. Which Brook studied this being, they look like an animal to say but more like a mix of a human too, just though wore gloves and shoes that appeared to be out of this world, to say everything about this being is out of this world, to say literally at that if what they saw above was a portal. They looked like to say a blue hedgehog of some kind, injured and hurt quite like how a human could be but still so much like a hedgehog, but Brook had to keep focus, quickly seemed to get up and go get a medkit from the bathroom, bringing it over and checking the injuries, even for what is in the kit too, taking her time now to begin to patch up each wound that could need some treatment to it. What was this? How come this happened? Oh she has many wonders on all of this but what is there for her to do about it? Least she can do is help. </p>

<p>Once Brook had it finished up, she put everything she was done with away into the medkit making sure it is all closed up before she put it away, then took a moment to then go get her drawing books, going back over to where this blue creature was and sat further away to just draw quietly, feeling the need to keep an eye on this being for who knows what kind of state they’re in. She has to help, it’s the least she can do after all. </p>

<p>It began to take time, waiting in some sense, drawing but it began to grow more of a worry by the second, glancing outside from time to time, it’s quite stressful, till looked down at the necklace she wore, studying the stone within it being a lapis lazuli color of sorts with faint white patterns, which looking upon it calmed her down as a way to know things should be alright, they have to be. Which then a loud gasp was heard from behind her, making her turn to look quickly even getting up in case to see this quilly fellow had shot up from where they sat eyes wide showing they’re like a emerald green, that quickly looked over at them when they looked around before screamed in surprise, making Brook stumble back from it, which instantly Brook signaled to them with her hands up speaking up quickly “Hey! Hey… it’s alright! I mean no harm, I found you outside hurt so I brought you in to help you…” Which caused this blue fellow to stop, seeming to understand exactly what they said, but that didn’t stop the blue being from panicking, suddenly in a blink they were in front of them and shaking her in a rush </p>

<p>“WHERE AM I!?? WHAT UNIVERSE IS THIS?? WHO ARE YOU AND THANK YOU?? OH NO WAIT EVERYONE BACK HOME COULD BE IN DANGER!” Can tell this blue being really spoke at quite a quick speed, even the shaking was quick, which caused Brook to have to try and signal again for them to settle down. “Woah, settle down, gee this is something not seen everyday. Look, my name is Brook, You’re in my home and I am not sure what this universe is called since well I am only finding out multiple exists but there are many humans like me here.” Once Brook did explain, can see this blue being calm down, letting go of her, taking a moment to breathe for a moment, which gave Brook a chance to do so as well for it is a lot to process at this very moment, universes?  different beings from them? Potential danger? It’s a lot to take in. </p>

<p>“Well, alright, Brook, my name is Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog, I came from Greenhill in my universe! Gotta say for someone who I thought would be terrified to see a hedgehog like me you’re quite calm about this!” Sonic seemed to respond with a smile, can tell he is friendly luckily, not something aggressive as one would’ve thought could happen. “Nice to meet you Sonic, as for that- well I’m not so sure myself, but then again you don’t mean any danger and I couldn’t leave someone hurt out there!” Brook replied to that with an honest answer causing Sonic to listen in, before thinking now, which seemed Sonic quickly dashed to the window to look outside, able to see he was there in a quick flash, different. A Blue hedgehog with quite the speed, surely out of this universe quite literally, but she knows he means no harm for could be cause she did help him now. </p>

<p>“So… Sonic, how exactly did you end up here anyhow?” Brook decided to ask watching Sonic look out the window which caused Sonic to turn and look at Brook. “Fell through a portal, I was trying to protect my friends from these weird lanky shadowy creatures which during this battle with a lot of them I remember being pushed into a portal that got me stuck here! Wait, was there more to it? My memory better not be failing me!” Sonic quickly turned to fully face Brook, can tell surely this all is yet quite the situation if anything, luckily it is just them here, otherwise who knows how the rest of Brook’s family would react to seeing a human behaving blue hedgehog with such extreme speed. “That’s- odd, well luckily you ended up here by chance, look, maybe you should eat something that could help! I made some cookies not long ago though I’m not sure if it’s safe for a creature like you-""SCORE!” Suddenly Sonic was gone in a blink of an eye, causing Brook to look around, going over to check maybe if they’re in a different room finding he is in the kitchen, popping a cookie into his mouth, which she is yet surprised for how fast he yet moves, how is it possible is what Brook yet wonders. </p>


<p>Sonic began to chew on the cookie in his mouth and swallowed, smiling once he did, speaking up looking over to where Brook is “These are top tier I got to say! Gotta be one of the many best chocolate chip cookies I had!” “Oh! Well, thank you? I am surprised for you to be able to eat chocolate cause it’s-""Dangerous? Pfft- nope! Not for a hedgehog like me! We aren’t like these animals in this universe! Yeah I think I figured where I am now cause I visited here before! But that’s a lot to explain huh?” Sonic quickly popped another cookie into his mouth enjoying each one quite a bit while Brook stood there trying to understand what he meant by all of that. A lot is being learnt once again, she surely was confused but willing to learn though, learn what it is about, to her it felt… familiar… Maybe because it’s from a dream she had or a story she heard that must be it! “How do you know about all of this?” Once Sonic heard Brook say that he looked over swallowing what was in his mouth, took a quick moment to think tapping his foot as if to help make his thought process hurry up before replied to it “Well I learned about it! I Have been traveling for years to many of them because I was given by a guardian some things to allow me to travel to any universe! Simple explanation really! Which is best to know since you did help me after all and are the first to really see me here, which reminds me I could travel back then!” Sonic seemed to then quickly try to reach for somewhere, but nothing, then checked around quickly on him, checking everywhere which caused him to grow a look of worry, suddenly dashing around the house seeing blue blurs all abouts around them then he was in front of Brook again looking very worried. </p>

<p>“Oh no oh no oh no! I lost them! I can’t find them anywhere! Did you see me with them when you found me??” “No I- I haven’t…” When Brook said that can see Sonic grow more worried seeing how he dashed around again trying to search for it while Brook was stuck watching, poor guy he could be stuck here if something isn’t done, thinking for a moment then spoke up now. “Sonic, if you came from a portal, then can’t you go back to it to get it? I mean there has to be some way, right?” Once Brook said that Sonic stopped right in front of her again, looking at her like he hasn’t thought of that, then quickly got hold of her arm with a smile “You’re a genius! To outside we check!” suddenly in a flash everything felt it was a blue blur for a moment then found both them were outside in that exact spot where Sonic was, able to see Sonic who was looking up to a portal way far up in the sky, tapping his foot quickly as if thinking for a way to get up there, which Brook looked as well, thinking, it surely is far up, hard to see if anything is on the other side of it, how is he supposed to get up there?</p>

<p>Sonic seemed to be thinking, looking up at it as checked the surroundings till suddenly was gone from where he was and dashed up jumping off and climbing things to get to a higher point as tries to jump up as high as he could and reached out to it but he couldn’t reach it, beginning to fall quickly that caused Brook to go abouts to where he was going to land but saw him manage to catch himself from the fall in some way curling into a ball and landed perfectly into a ball that uncurled as he stood up quickly, thinking now. “Surely seems very far so who knows if you will be able to just jump up high enough to reach it, how even is there one anyways?” Brook looked over at Sonic, quite curious if anything could be figured out for this which caused Sonic to look over quickly for a moment then back at the portal. “Well, it kind of just showed up, along with many other ones in my universe that spilled out these weird creatures that are wrecking everything! Which means there could be portals soon about to open here then! Oh this better not be something Eggman is causing!” Can tell Sonic seemed to get angry at the thought of whoever this Eggman they mentioned is, what ever could be causing it surely seems to be something not good, something that could be a danger to many universes, something inside them, it’s like it’s telling her she must stop this, which to wonder who else will anyways? She has to do something. Dedication… unlike others</p>

<p>“We gotta stop this… the world could be in danger.” Brook said, looking over to where Sonic is, which Sonic heard, then smiled at that as if he was glad to hear that from someone else. “I like that attitude! I think you and I can stop this! As of now, luckily there aren't any other portals opening around, right?” When Sonic said that, the sounds of someone screaming could be heard from behind them, causing both to look over to see others running in fear while creatures chased them roaring, these creatures all purely black like a shadow of a human except there was no hair, no clothes, no parts of one, but darkness, yet appeared like a shadow, which can see one looked over at them slowly, eyeing them with the eyes it lacked before it roared out charging down to go after them with others following behind it quickly, bad timing to jinx that. This caused Sonic to react fast, stepping in front of Brook quickly and curled into a ball suddenly seeming to turn quickly causing a blue glow of sorts around him to suddenly see when done he dashed towards them rolling fast hitting multiple of them quickly, before uncurled jumping up hitting any of the ones nearby who tried to attack back but got hurt which the others began dashing towards Brook fast. Brook had to think fast, she had to, quickly moving to the side seeing how one charged but missed her, causing them to look over charging again but Brook moved aside. What are these things? For what she can study they sure are tall beings with claw-like hands and yet no face with it, which when grabbed a stick nearby to try and hit them, it just went through them like nothing was there, like an attempt to hit your shadow but there is no luck to it, this is bad. </p>

<p>“WATCH OUT!” seemed suddenly was picked up and moved aside quickly to see it was Sonic who saved them from being hit seeing the creature destroy what it’s hit into, which Sonic quickly placed Brook down standing in front of them and dashed towards each of them curling into a ball when they jumped up to hit each one in the head, which then one got hold of Sonic by the leg and crashed him to the ground, She has to do something to help, Sonic needs her help. Quickly she got hold of one the folded chairs nearby and hit them away from Sonic, trying to hit each one back as quick as she could, till they got hold of the chair and tossed it away which Brook went with it hitting into the grass rolling across it, which surely hurt her arm that crashed into the ground first, that is going to leave a bruise. She tried to get up quickly, she had to fight, which saw these creatures start to charge towards her but then Sonic seemed to have gotten up quickly and hit each one away, quickly going over and getting hold of Brook’s arm dragging them further away as if to get more distance. </p>

<p>“What are these things!?” “I am not sure! But they seem to be trying to go after you though so stick by me! We can blast through this with Sonic speed!” Sonic seemed to quickly respond to Brook, going in front of them again, then quickly curled up into a ball seeming to spin quickly once again in this ball form before charged at the creatures that tried to charge back at them hitting a lot of them, which Brook tried to follow with, although she cannot fight the greatest she has to try, can’t let Sonic do this alone. Which yet became quite the battle, Sonic was hitting many of these creatures as fast and as hard as he could and was able to get down a few but yet more keep coming, which Sonic often had to keep close to Brook from the many going after her which she had to use what was around to fight back, hitting with either a folded chair, a stick, a branch at some point, a piece of would even a poking stick of sorts that went to the fire she found to keep them away, except no matter how hard both them fought they kept coming, there has to be a way around this, even for the portals one can find opening abouts the area, there has to be another way, which to guess is to run, escape far, at least try to. </p>

<p>“Sonic I don’t think we can keep this up forever! More keeps coming!” Brook shouted having to grab their pencil from her pocket to stab the creature to get them to back off. “Yeah that would be a good idea- Come on! Follow me! Can find a spot around here to hide at!” Sonic shouted back, seeming to then quickly hit many away to create a path, dashing away which Brook quickly followed with dodging the vicious swipes from the creatures. When Brook turned the corner she saw Sonic being stopped by a crowd of these creatures ahead, trying to fight each of them off which she was about to go help, but she felt she slipped and fell, but fell as though for a long time, hearing Sonic shout “BROOK!” which where she looked she saw, a portal, seeing Sonic reach out but the creatures dragged Sonic away as she was yet falling, as though she yet fell right into one, before then she crashed to the ground, hitting a surface that felt, soft and fluffy, but felt weak, looking around slowly to see tall dark brown trees and snow on the ground but that was all she saw before everything yet went into a black, leaving her at what was a warm day to be stuck in a very cold place all by herself in an unfamiliar world.</p>

<h5>Don’t worry, things will be alright in the end…</h5>
<h5>The reckoning will stop, his madness will soon.</h5>
<h5>You will be safe… </h5>

<h2>Chapter 16. More to come</h2>

<p>Blue skies, green all around for everywhere they walked, surely to think this place is all just so colorful, but how can such a colorful place be in such danger of the portals all around with creatures going all around the place? It makes everything look more gloom and upsetting then as colorful as it’s believed to be, such a cheery place it does appear to be despite the current disaster that it’s no surprise why Mugman is so cheery as well, it really must be the universe he is from if it did seem to be so cheery. “Okay! I got another one! Who here has seen what’s called a ‘meteor shower’?” Bendy asked everyone, which can tell everyone looked between one another to see who’d speak up first to this question. “Oh! OH! I think I remember seeing one when I was really young! I remember my parents took me and my brother to see them! I think it is planned to happen again sometime this year too! It is planned for me and my whole family to go see it” Mugman exclaimed in quite the excitement as he led the way, which everyone listened in and now it was whoever next to say if they have or haven’t. “Eh, never actually seen real stars.” “How??? You’ve seen snow obviously and that’s like an outside thing!” </p>

<p>“Maybe because it’s in a mountain that yet has quite grown to have a lot of nature growing within it, somehow it does happen to manage to thrive within that state, probably because of how the temperature and air could be in there.” Sans explained to Bendy who was questioning how Sans did not see any stars before, which Bendy just stared at him, seeming to try to understand but couldn’t get it entirely. “Wh-” “That is quite a rare occurrence to happen to think, must be one the greatest things to occur for your universe.” Baldi interrupted Bendys confused state seeming Baldi grasped the idea far faster then Bendy could, guess it does go to show Baldi must be smart enough to understand such a phenomenon like that. “As for myself, I never got the chance to see it, I’ve heard of it and heard it’s happened but I was never lucky enough to get to see it myself during those times I could’ve” Baldi now added his response to this question for everyone which Bendy looked to him hearing it then looked to Brook now, it was just him and Brook who need to answer it. “Brook, what about you?” Bendy now asked, to give the idea he wants her to go first. “I don’t think so, I mean I’ve seen several shooting stars before in a row one day but it wasn’t exactly a meteor shower since it didn’t have the amount and correct timing to be one.” “perhaps you’ll remember this…”</p>

<p>“Sheesh you sound like you love stars for saying it like that, as for me I never have seen stars at all actually, mostly cause my universe is literally mostly just a building you're stuck in, an old, medallion and bronze colored like building, other words for those colors I said is orange and yellow.” Bendy added his answer as well after Brook said hers, which did seem to bring more questions for everyone to ask one another now, but of course can’t seem to have the chance to ask more since everyone noticed Mugman quickly ran ahead seeming excited to see something now. “WE’RE HERE! WE’RE HERE!” Mugman shouted running over to this dice like door that seems to have a sign above with lights saying ‘ISLE 2’ which must be a good sign, which speaking of good signs so far seems there isn’t really any COTS around to mess this up, well hopefully it isn’t even some jinx too. “ALRIGHT! PERFECT! And look at how lucky we’ve been! Barely any COTS around, not even some dangerous one at all, which although is annoying because it could hint where some of those guys are BUT HEY! We are making progress! What can stop us now??” Bendy shouted with excitement rushing to the door Mugman was at ready to help out to open it if needed which Sans walked over as Brook was about to as well she stopped due to noticing Baldi wasn’t following, which was odd, causing Brook to look to him and the rest did end up doing so as well. “This seems too easy to do, in fact, seems perhaps it could be a trap, what could be on the other side could be far worse then where we are now, perhaps an ambush is waiting on the other side or perhaps there has been something set up for anyone who tried to flee this direction, it’s best if we check first before running in there and risk falling right into some trap.” Baldi explained his concerns which everyone did look to one another not really having thought of, which yet Bendy did smile seeming to have just the idea about this. “Well leave it to me for that! A trap wouldn’t be able to catch me that easily! Watch!” Bendy spoke up as he quickly entered the dice first just seeming to quickly instead become a puddle and go through so in case the door had some trap setup, able to hear him go through even to the other side of the place as everyone kind of waited now. Then can suddenly see Bendy hop right back out in this puddle then to normal as he looked to the rest in a rush quickly signaling them to move. “BRUTE- BRUTE LIKE COTS! MOVEEEE!” Bendy shouted, causing everyone to quickly dash away from the door before seeing a hole be made right into the door seeing a COTS that did look quite large and powerful roar at them before charging at them, which quickly everyone moved to the side which Sans helped everyone do so for seems he must’ve timed and figured right when it was going to go by correctly, seeing it ram right into a tree making this brute like COTS get dizzy do to the impact. </p>

<p>“HAH! SUCKER!” “Bendy taunting it is never a good idea.” Sans spoke up when Bendy did taunt it, which Bendy looked to Sans thinking nothing would go wrong before seeing the brute COTS pull out a tree from within the ground readying to throw it at them, which caused everyone to quickly begin to run again and prepare for it, everyone quickly going behind some trees as the tree crashed into some the trees they hid behind, luckily it missed them but pieces surely did go flying everywhere from the impact of it, yeah this is quite the situation and they all got to do something about it. “Wh-What do we do!??” Mugman shouted to everyone seeming so worried this could be really bad which can tell everyone was thinking up what to do about this and fast. “Okay, I got an idea perhaps, probably won’t be effective but maybe if we can tire out this brute can be possible to get it down better, it’s best if we handle this thing now so it won’t get in are way later, If we all each go to a side could be possible to throw this brute off course, then one of us has to get it in it’s weak spot, if it has one.” Sans explained up a plan he thought of which everyone listened in agreeing with it quite quickly. “I think I caught sight of where its weak spot is, it’s the back, it can’t reach anyone or attack there it seems and the movement makes it seem it’s weak around there.” Baldi spoke up, just seeming he was keeping an eye on the creature to figure it out more properly. </p>

<p>“Alright! Me and Brook will go near the back range then!” Bendy already got ready just going over to where Brook was. Who was surprised to hear that Bendy wants her help in doing the attacking part? Sure she can try that, it shouldn't be difficult, better then just listening. “Okay, I will go to the furthest side then.” Sans spoke up as well, seeming ready to do so. “Alright then I will-” But before Baldi could say can hear the loud roar from this brute COTS hearing it begin to try and rip through the trees, which yet just made it clear everyone didn’t have much time, quickly can see Sans start to head to his spotting for where his was, which can notice Bendy quickly get Brook by the arm to pull her along to where there spotting was, which surprised Brook but she followed quickly as she noticed Baldi and Mugman quickly figured there spots after they talked as can hear Sans call the brute COTS over so it can buy everyone more time, the setup is working, which everyone was now in there spots for what can be seen, just now Brook and Bendy need to prepare, or so mostly Brook since how is she going to be able to hit this brute COTS hard enough to take it down when Bendy surely is far more capable of doing a good impact. </p>

<p>“Alright! I bet we’ll be able to hit it hard enough for it to go down! Right?” Bendy asked Brook which Brook did look to him just unsure but gave a smile. “Yeah… I’m sure- ""That’s an unsure look not a sure look, hey, look, I’m sure with us both we got this, even if you don’t have powers you are strong I can tell that! So come on, let’s awaken that strength you got somewhere and do this” Bendy quickly interrupted Brook’s lie giving more of a way to be reassured which made Brook smile to that feeling more ready once hearing that as both pay attention now seeing Mugman then call the brute COTS over, which it tried going over, then can see Baldi called it over, causing it to go over, exposing its back for a bit but then can see Sans call it over cause it got to close, alright its a cycle to try and lure it in a good way, maybe they can call it over too so it can be further from where Baldi is so the back is exposed longer. Which Bendy was quick to call it right over which it did begin to come over which felt a little bit scary but then can hear Baldi do so once it got real close, which exposed the back now, alright they got to attack fast, which quickly Bendy rushed out Brook did follow getting the pencil she has out so it can do better damage as they both hit right into it’s back hard, Bendy hitting with the hardest punch he could do and Brook just trying to stab it with the pencil the best she can. Which made this Brute COTS scream in pain but it didn’t go down, just looking back at the two who were there, which made them both back away fast, this isn’t good. </p>

<p>Suddenly when the brute COTS roared at them can see suddenly just this rope of some kind come from somewhere and stab into its back, then more, in fact soon multiple ropes came and stabbed into its back hearing it scream in pain, before going away like how the rest did just like a shadow, which means such a foe is handled with now, but what handled it? Nobody here happens to do that, which can see Sans, Mugman and Baldi come out from hiding now seeing it handled but they all were just as confused too, which they looked to where abouts the ropes came from and just saw two pairs of eyes in the shadows of the trees, blank white eyes staring back at them before seeming to close and reopen to be lower kind of eyes seeming to watch the group, odd. It almost felt like it was a danger, but then again whoever it was, surely it did save them. Just everyone isn’t sure what to say due to how it watched, except Mugman was the only one who wasn’t scared. “Hello! Uhm- Thank you for saving us all there that COTS could’ve really hurt us! What’s your name perhaps?.” Mugman calmly spoke up, walking over carefully which can tell Sans did seem to want to stop Mugman but didn’t, just watching now seemingly closely. </p>

<p>“Hm?... oh… Hello, I-... just wanted to help, I don’t want to bother now I should go…” Can hear a calm, really quiet voice reply, able to see how it did try to go but Mugman went over speaking up. “Hey! No it’s okay! You’re not bothering us at all! You don’t have to be afraid really, how about you come out so we all can properly thank you!” Mugman replied, which can tell this quiet person paused, looking to Mugman for what one can see in the darkness before hesitantly stepping out now which Mugman gave quiet encouragement for that, able to see something like a mug as well for how Mugman is but not exactly for how it looked all of them had this drip look all around and this black liquid was coming out from there head covering half their face while they had this rope on their neck and a similar outfit to Mugmans almost but just darker and has more merlot like color different from Mugmans blue coloration, as the eyes were low but purely white, able to tell right away how hesitant they were and Mugman studied confused and curious now. “Huh, similar kind of thing when we saw the DDraig guy.” Sans spoke up, which Bendy looked at Sans then back getting excited, “HAH! THIS COULD BE A SIGN!” Bendy excitedly yelled a bit which made this person startled and seem to want to try and go but Mugman reassured them to try and stay. </p>

<p>Can tell Baldi was confused  by all of this looking to Brook for answers which Brook did have answers but can tell she didn’t want to say them because of the current situation going on for someone else is here now. “Don’t worry about what they say! We are just searching for this bad group that could be around while we also look for where my familys gone” Mugman explained to this other quiet mug who looked to Mugman studying before tilting their head hearing it. “Really?... Uhm… I think I saw some people like you come by earlier… Saying they got to get to this safe zone in isle 3? Something like that…” This person quietly explained which got Mugman more excited since he seems to know exactly where that is which is quite a good thing if so, means they're getting somewhere but yet can tell this person had an unsure look seeing Mugmans excitement. “Except… It’s dangerous the further you go ahead… There's someone here just bringing more and more bad things into this area to try and go after those who are hiding…” This person quietly explained which caused more worry to come upon Mugmans face, especially everyone else's hearing such a thing. “Well, If we want to help with Mugmans family thing and stop all of this, then we will go there quickly.” Brook spoke up, looking to the rest which can tell right away Bendy got hyped up first upon hearing it.</p>

 <p>“YEAH! THAT’S EXACTLY RIGHT BROOK! COME ON! WE CAN DO THIS GUYS!” Bendy yelled with excitement which did begin to help encourage everyone else more about this. “Yeah! Hehe thank you uh-” “...Solgo.” Can hear the person quietly reply which Mugman looked at and smiled once finally getting an answer on what their name is. “Solgo! Nice to meet you Mrs- or Mr? Sorry! It’s a bit hard to tell…” Mugman quickly apologized, not sure if he could have messed it up or not, which can tell Solgo just stared for a moment before speaking up with a quiet “It’s mrs…” which Mugman felt relieved once hearing he was right the first time. “Alright! Well really thank you for it!” “Wait… Solgo, you said someone is here bringing more of the bad things otherwise known as COTS here, correct? Who and where perhaps are they?” Baldi asked after Mugman spoke, which can already tell Baldi remembered that and was curious, already becoming helpful for all of this. “Uhm… oh… Her- she's-... Sorry I can’t tell you… otherwise...” Solgo grew hesitant, looking down just seems like they have the answer they want to say but something prevents them, but what is? Almost seems so similar to the previous ones, perhaps this even gives a clue what it actually is. “Otherwise what?? We can take whoever it is if they try anything! We have before with two other guys!” Bendy exclaimed, able to tell he really wants everyone to have some answer, some clue to who it is but Solgo just seems they couldn’t budge with this one.  </p>

<p>“I’m sorry I-... really can’t…” Solgo looked down, which made Bendy sigh after not getting an answer, able to tell Mugman felt bad while Sans and Baldi seem to be quietly discussing what it could be as if there trying to figure it out without having to push questions, while Brook watched thinking what to do about all of this currently, there has to be something to do to figure perhaps help her not feel so scared or shy to say. </p>

<h5>Watching…</h5>

<p>It’s what echoed through her head again, which made her quietly check around the area for a sign of anything, till noticing what seems like just in the darkness there was some COTS watching, like there collecting the information perhaps to pass it on, which yet makes sense now, no wonder why Solgo won’t say. “Hey… It’s okay... Solgo you don’t have to say, we won’t force it, just at least for now if we can’t have it answered we can find some way to figure it out just you gotta be careful from any-""WOAH WOAH WOAH! BROOK WE CAN’T JUST DROP THIS AND TRY AND PUZZLE IT TOGETHER WHAT ARE YOU DOING??” Bendy quickly interrupted, clearly instantly confused why Brook decided to do this, but Brook wasn’t surprised by this reaction, in fact she had a way to respond to it. “It’s okay, just trust me on this and focus ahead.” Brook responded which made Bendy more confused, seeming to try and put it together now looking ahead and now a bit around trying to figure if Brook was telling him something till he noticed it too now for what she saw before which seems he was impressed pretty quickly. “Uhm… Thank you for understanding…” Solgo mumbled which Brook gave a calm nod to, which can tell Mugman was confused wanting to get answers too and understand which can tell Bendy quietly helped out with that so it won’t be something Brook would have to handle too. “You’re welcome Solgo, just please be careful and also I suspect someone would be looking for you” Brook added that little fact which made Solgo confused and curious before just giving a nod in understanding then turning away giving everyone a small wave bye before they walked away, which Brook watched or more so mostly the COTS to see they began to watch Solgo perhaps to either follow Solgo or perhaps they are before they flee, which yet once Solgo was far enough can tell instantly chaos was just about to happen judging by the look Bendy got after that. </p>

<p>“THEY WERE BEING WATCHED AND YOU NOTICED THAT!?? WE ARE GETTING SOMEWHERE WITH ANSWERS HERE I AM TELLING YOU! SHEESH WAIT WHAT IF THIS PERSON TRIES TO TRICK US TOO?? INKY LORD IS THAT GONNA BE ANNOYING!” Bendy shouted just pacing a bit as he said that while clearly questioning on how Brook saw that, which yeah it was hard to see but she just kinda figured out something was there somehow. “So how are we going to figure this out?” Sans asked, which can tell Baldi seemed to try and think of an answer already in case Brook didn’t have one, which she did somewhat, she isn’t sure if it would work but it might. “We could- Follow those COTS watching, they have to all be connected right? Which I’m sure it’s likely those COTS would not just lead to whoever is causing this but also to Mugmans family since surely they must be trying to find some way to get to anyone.” Brook explained which Mugman looked to Brook hopeful already once hearing that while the rest seemed to begin to think about this now, it does seem like quite the plan now. “Let’s do it! It must have to lead to that meanie causing this! Plus it could save even my family and everyone else in this universe!” Mugman exclaimed which who knows how long saved would be or if it would even be but the positivity is there showing he believes this could work, it has to. </p>

<p>“Alright, perhaps the most logical thing to start with is following those COTS, so shall we all get moving?” Baldi stated while questioning if everyone was ready which yet Mugman quickly began to get going shouting “LET’S GO SAVE THEM!” causing Sans to quickly follow perhaps to be sure he won’t enter any danger then causing Baldi to follow quickly, then Bendy laughed a little at this happening before going on which Brook began to follow with now. But as they entered the darkness of the forest just felt she lost focus, like she was elsewhere and the area was dark, she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear the rest now, everywhere was darkness. What was happening? <h5>”Such a mystery why you try, they are all capable themselves, why are you following?”</h5>  A voice echoed through her head which made her feel she was frozen in place, she heard a voice nearby but nobody was there, a voice that felt familiar but yet too dangerous, what is happening? Why won’t it go away, why can’t she move? <h5>”Struggling won’t ever get you far, no where farther for when it’s discovered who you are.”</h5>  The voice she heard began to laugh as she tried to keep focus and ignore it and only then does it seem the darkness fades even though it still felt it was watching when she heard a voice call through it all. </p>

<p>“Brook! Brook hey focus on me, come on Brook!” Can finally realize who was talking was Bendy, but it still felt like now the darkness was around them both, but Bendy doesn’t seem worried about it, he doesn’t see it does he? “Brook look, it’s okay, heyyy.. Brook I don’t know what you could be seeing or hearing here but look it’s okay, you’re not there that stuff isn’t real here…” Can hear properly how Bendy was seeming really worried, which yet focusing on him can see better how he was and how the darkness was fading, what happened is all she wonders, where was she anymore aside from somewhere with Bendy. “...What happened?...” Brook asked quietly which can tell calmed Bendy hearing some kind of response, which he stayed nearby incase of anything it surely seems. “For all I know we entered the forest and when the darkness hit the area in a sudden wave you just froze, the rest went ahead already, guess they aren’t used to hearing when somethings up.” Bendy responded, just can tell his full focus was on Brook, he didn’t even check if the rest were close or anything, he just has his focus on Brook which at least the darkness seemed it was decreasing around now, even the place seemed to gain a lot more light around too, which was luckily calming to see some light and even know one isn’t alone right now. </p>

<p>“Oh… So was I the only one who heard a voice?-” “There was no voice. And if there was it would’ve been one of are voices. Nobody else is here okay? We’re all safe, now come on, remember what I said about the darkness before? The darkness could be scary but you can always find something out of it all once you get through it, which we will together” Bendy interrupted Brook able to tell he was quick to want Brook to not have to worry anymore and not think to much, which he came nearby just getting Brook by the hand to bring along onward, which although it surprised Brook she followed able to understand he was surely helping, he is such a nice friend to think for doing all of this. As they walked can begin to see the rest again able to tell they all must’ve stopped seeming confused where the two went, which can see Mugman notice them first and wave over, which Bendy quickly went forward but still brought Brook along which Brook did follow more to try and keep up and also be able to see how the rest are doing and if anything has been found. </p>

<p>“There you both are, what were you both doing?” Sans asked, which Brook felt she had to try to answer but Bendy was fast to be the one to do so. “It was simply something that came up with Brook and I helped out with it, got to look out for one another after all!” Bendy answered, looking at Brook with a smile then the rest who accepted that answer pretty easily without much questions or trying to figure some advanced way for anyone to understand without having to say what happened, surely is different in Brooks eyes. Then can see the rest began to continue walking into the darkness where can see slightly COTS sneaking in the darkness ahead, unless she is seeing stuff, which yet Bendy stared at that darkness, then to Brook and held her hand more which Brook forgot Bendy was as Bendy leaded the way in as Brook followed, to guess he didn’t want Brook to be scared or risk being stuck like that again which is nice to think, he’s already looking out for perhaps everyone to bet. As they walked through, they could even notice that Mugman was getting a bit scared as they went through but can tell he really wanted to try and get through so he can find his family.</p>

<p>Brook carefully was able to move a bit more ahead and offered her hand to Mugman now which Mugman noticed and happily accepted to hold on and follow along with feeling more brave now too, which Bendy smiled at Brook noticing how she did what he did for her, guess it shows they all quite are bonding this way. Which yet can tell Sans and Baldi kind of noticed what was going on which both looked to one another after noticing then focused on ahead, to guess they weren’t scared about this which is good that they aren’t really, even if they were though they can join in so that way everyone can know there in this together. While walking it’s odd to notice there are a few hints of COTS moving around within the darkness, but yet none are attacking strangely, although surely it’s clear to keep a guard up incase, seeing this go on is certainly a strange thing. Unless it is meant to be some kind of planned attack, which means things can be quite bad if they aren’t careful, at least it seems they’re all getting somewhere in this darkness, just who knows what where is for how darker it felt it was becoming, which although it worried Brook she can feel Bendy hold her hand more each time she worried even in the slightest as a way to remind her it’s all okay, which she did the same to hold Mugmans hand more so Mugman doesn’t get worried and scared like how she would be. Which soon the area was just darkness, not a clear path to take at all but to follow any signs of movement and the only hints of light there is was Sans’s eyes that were ahead that seemed to glow in this darkness, which everyone must’ve used as an idea to know where to go, which Sans had to get used to the staring he must be sensing everyones doing but, it’s a dark area where are they to go? As they get closer they can start hearing the faint noises the COTS are making somewhere in the darkness, animal like noises that’s what they surely sound like, makes this a bit scarier to go walking through, but if anything were to happen all of them should be ready, they have to be. Which yet it felt like the darkness only felt it was worse which yet felt like everyone stayed closer together, something was wrong, something very much was, but what was it? How is Brook to know she can’t see here and the same goes with the rest. </p>

<p>“Guys?... Why do I feel crawling on my back?...” Mugman hesitantly spoke with a tremble in his scared voice which yet can feel how Bendy must’ve moved more to guess where Mugman was and trying to help which yet during this stop can see Sans quickly manage to finally summon a bone that had a faint glow that allowed them all to see, which once they all can, can see all sorts of COTS surrounding them and this large spider like one just above them seeming ready to strike at any given moment, which once everyone got a good chance to see, only one word just needed to be said to get the complete idea on what to do instead of stand useless here facing these COTS. “RUN!” </p>

<h5>Why fear something so simple like the dark or a plant?</h5>
<h5>Perhaps we all fear things unknowing  what their capabilities are…</h5>
<h5>Perhaps we all just don’t know who’s watching.</h5>

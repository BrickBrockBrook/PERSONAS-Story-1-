<h2>Chapter 30. The Destination</h2>


<p>It’s cold. It feels so cold like being in a freezer or outside during a cold winter night, but not cold where it could hurt you, no, it’s the exact temperature where it bugs you enough to feel chilly but not enough to hurt you, just enough to torment. As one finally opened there eyes can see the stone cold ground they were stuck upon, trying to reach to get up off from the stone cold ground found one couldn’t like there arms were stuck in place and sure enough they were seeming to be tied up to keep them from escaping wherever they were and if that wasn’t secure enough for wherever this place was seemed to look they were trapped in this prison of sorts, the door locked tight so she can’t go anywhere, the place left with a settle darkness to really mess with there mind, leaving unknown if there's anyone ahead or walking along within the darkness. So in a scared, lost and confused attempt Brook spoke up. “Hello? Anyone here??” She spoke out, only to find the echoes of her voice be the only response she had upon doing so. Though soon another voice spoke out, a voice unfamiliar speaking with a deep tone, a voice that felt unwelcoming but confident. “It appears you are up now. You’ve made quite a remarkable effort with you and your little followers.” This voice sounded it got closer revealing its smile within the darkness but the vines all wrapped around areas on this person, the most on their one arm, seeming to wear an almost fancy like outfit almost suit appearing but not exactly in this beige coloration while it seems this person is mostly black and white themselves for their main body, a devil to almost look to be judging even their tail matching one of a devil sneakily moving within the darkness, all then tied together with a cigar in their mouth. </p>

<p>“They aren’t my followers. They’re my friends” Brook spoke up at the voice who began to laugh at hearing Brook respond, seeming to have a vine open the cell door that she was locked in to step inside. “You have quite the confidence now speaking like that to someone who's far beyond your power of yours, which is what might I add? Playing artist drawing in this little book?" They walked over, walking around Brook before near the end saying that pulled out the drawing book she had this person laughing as Brook tried to reach for it back but couldn’t. “You’ve met many along the way I see, some of my most valued helpers and some of my least, quite impressive how you’ve handled each one.” This person flipped through the book while holding their cigar, getting some of the ash on the pages before closing it to really smudge it in the pages before tossing it to the ground as Brook watched it slide along before it halted, nearly hitting the wall, too far from reach where she was. “You’re Storsi, aren’t you?” Brook was quick to figure due to the mention that those are their helpers, so it comes to the likely possibility they could very well be that person, after all it makes sense. “The one and only. Quite interesting you’ve figured that out. But no time for distractions on that. What we should focus on is where is that gem you had?” Storsi answered, having that evil grin that never left his face, it felt twisted, it felt unsettling, a feeling they are getting joy out of this, seeing Brook trapped unable to do much of anything. </p>

<p>“It’s not here.” Brook spoke up, not afraid despite when all odds can very well be against her, what is she to even do anyway against anyone let alone this person who leads a dangerous group of people. “Then where is it?” Storsi then started to demand, stepping over as he exhaled out the smoke from his cigar that went all in Brooks face making her cough and back away while she coughed. “It won’t matter, since you will be defeated” Brook glared at Storsi but yet when Storsi shot one back it’s when she felt to cower, which seems to be the reaction he must’ve been hoping for, walking away back to where they came in from fixing his cigar while doing so. “You have quite the nerve talking to someone that way, do you even KNOW what I can do? Do you even have the abilities to face up against someone such as me? HM? Or are you just scared, trying to appear superior out of fear.” Storsi looked over and can see how he glared at her it’s hard to see his eyes at all for the shadow always seem to cast it over his face in such a way, but one can surely feel the glare for how it stings and feels it could make your bones shake and crumble, just causing Brook to move further back upon it seeing that only made Storsi grin once again seeing that as he took another puff from his cigar. “That’s what I thought. Now, I guess we’d have to get answers out of you in a different way, but for now, I will give you a chance to brace yourself till then while I choose the perfect person to have their fun with you.” Storsi spoke up then tossing his cigar away onto the ground seeming to be done with it, before opening the cells door and closing it, locking it before leaving off and away into the darkness unknown where, leaving Brook stuck watching, only left now to figure out some plan to get out but, how can she? These guys are far more powerful then her so if she's caught she's done but at that it’s locked the door she can’t open it nor even slide through the bars, along with that she's tied up, there’s not much she can do here, sure she can move to some the other walls but…</p>

<h5>Don’t give up</h5>

<p>A voice echoed in her head, causing her to look around almost like she's trying to find where she heard it despite it being in her head. </p>

<h5>Help is here</h5>

<p>It echoed again, confusing her but yet, that voice hasn’t failed her yet really, so if there's someone or something that can help… So she decided to speak up again as a hope there is something. “Is anyone here?” She spoke out, watching outside the bars for anything at all, hoping for something, some sort of sign, hoping for if someone is there. It was silence, a long quiet silence, waiting for something but yet nothing can be heard, she waited more only to see the cells door slowly open, like someone chose to open it  slowly, unable to see who but can slightly see a hand that seems to be wearing black fingerless gloves of sorts which yet seemed familiar just by that. Then soon after a pair of two maroon dots can be seen glowing in the darkness feeling like eyes staring right at her, but yet those pair of eyes felt familiar, like she's seen them quite a few times before, it’s just hard to tell if it’s comforting or if there is immediate danger. But yet, a voice deep that had an echo spoke out. “You’ve come far.” It spoke with a tone that once again added familiarity, which must conclude she must know who this is. “Stiex?” She spoke up, seeing how it seemed he paused for a moment before speaking again. “Still strange as ever.” He replied, guess that confirms that this must be Stiex since he didn’t deny that, what brings him here anyway? He was staying clear of here but here he is let alone in a place like this. “What brings you here?” Brook spoke up, which can see Stiex stepped into the cell as well going to stand in front of where Brook was, standing there looking down upon Brook stuck there, it felt intimidating, it felt any second he could brutally beat them up all in seconds but yet he stared down, a look that felt sharp like daggers but ones that aren’t meant to hurt, more so observe, testing the limits to see if it would break anyone down. </p>

<p>“Just giving you a simple job you already were taking.” Stiex spoke, before crouching down to look at Brook properly. “You’ve been doing all sorts of shit around here, trying to stop these dumbasses doing this. Though it would be pointless for you to for the shit that will happen later. …I’ve decided otherwise. You want the portals to stop?” Stiex asked, doing some rough explaining on what he wants, to which Brook gave a nod in response to hearing that. “Then you’re stopping them.” Stiex then stood up again seeming to get out a knife from his pocket in a quick motion before taking aim then slicing what kept Brook trapped right off in another quick motion leaving maroon particles to trail behind when making those slicing motions, before stepping back to let Book have a chance to take a moment to have room to get up. Brook took a moment to ensure she's freed before slowly getting up regaining her balance trying to not fall over before looking to Stiex who already was leaving the cell now almost like his job here was done but Brook quickly went after to follow behind, causing Stiex to sense and look over to her. “Wait! Where are you going??” Brook asked which Stiex just gave a look of questioning why she is asking this. “I got shit to do. So do you.” Stiex answered, turning around to try and walk off before Brook stopped him once again by running ahead to stand in his way. “But I can’t do this alone! I- I don’t have powers to face any of the rest if they found me, they’d toss me back then who knows what! How am I supposed to stop this whole thing if there are people and these COTS roaming around who’d attack any chance they get!” Brook explained which Stiex just stared it felt he must’ve been annoyed or was he just listening in? Or was he perhaps concerned? It’s really hard to tell with him due to how his expressions only change so little. “Alright.” Stiex then seemed to then start to walk onwards going around Brook, but yet paused when further ahead to look back at Brook, almost like a sign he’s getting them to follow him around. </p>

<p>Brook hurried onwards running to where Stiex was to begin to follow as Stiex leaded the way onwards through the darkness up what seems like stairs hidden in the darkness heading up to reach a door above seeing he only opened it slightly to listen and study around before opening it fully ensuring Brook is following which she stayed close by, though she couldn’t stay too close for how his tail kept whipping Brook back away from his back, so she kept her distance to respect that. Once fully entering can see they were in one the halls that was quite large of one, a clean  dark stone like flooring with the walls stretching with a gray color with tints of orange that looks some spots were roughened up by impacts of sorts, the lighting having what looks alike to lanterns above on the ceiling stretching along in an elegant pattern to bring the place a dim lighting, allowing for there to be many shadows along in corners or against the walls to make it pop for the carpet along the floor of a deep maroon, darker then the maroon on Stiex who yet leaded the way sticking close to the shadows while Brook followed lead, despite how she didn’t want to lurk in the dark she has a hunch Stiex knew what he was doing. While they walked turning down into some halls, although a silence remained it felt a lot was being said just by the surroundings. One the halls they started heading down has windows showing the outside being far more colorful and bright, seeing a city out there currently surrounded by portals but yet despite it the buildings colors were vibrant and beautiful, the light shined on them in a way to make them pop out more, even seeing not these clouds or steam but alike of these vibrant colors surrounding around almost making it magical even seeing it spread out to what looks like another city farther from it that looked far larger than the one they seem to be in. </p>

<p>This left  Brook to want to ask questions about this place but before she can it’s like Stiex knew. “You’re in the In Between Universe. Currently the city you are in is Resuria City. A city that got made for more other fucks to move in if Kaletc City was too busy or some shit.” Stiex spoke up which yet left more questions for Brook which to guess he figured that out to, all while still taking them onwards to wherever they must be headed to find what's causing these portals. “No, I cannot answer why the universe is called that. It’s simply called the universe anyone from anywhere can live in, doesn’t matter what you are for species. Considered a magical place for many. Now that’s all i’m saying about this, if you want a tour go fucking elsewhere for that.” Stiex then carried on not seeming to answer any more, which Brook looked on to the city there is, thinking on it all seeing those portals covering it being clear none were meant to be there, she truly hopes the rest are okay out there, they should be able to get here, they got to, Just keep going onwards to reach the goal then maybe they’d be able to stop this all. </p>

<hr class="new2">


<p>The loud placement of metallic parts can be heard dropped onto the table before being quickly looked through looking for a piece in the mess to try and find something seeming to find the piece they were looking for and quickly go over to a frame that looks to have spots with dust collected but were swept off at one the spots to add a part to it, which another handed a tool to them to help get it in place which yet can hear another walk over with some papers studying the progress that’s being made. “So you’re confident this will work?” The person being a skeleton spoke up while the toon who was putting the part in looked over and smiled. “Of course I'm sure Sans! I’ve read the book that came with it over a hundred times this has to work! And now knowing what it is to power it, then we shouldn’t fail!” Bendy explained which yet another pitched in. “Do you still have that book by chance? Maybe there's a step that was missed?” “Oh yeah I believe it’s just on the shelf” Bendy answered Baldi who had asked which yet can see Sonic dash by to head to the shelf and quickly found the book dashing back to hand to Baldi to look through and see if there was anything that was missed. “ARE WE DONE,DONE YETTTT??” Jevil hopped over while giving Mugman a piggyback ride making Mugman giggle and laugh for it seems Mugman was keeping Jevil entertained while waiting despite seeming he was the one more entertained. “Not yet, still got a few more spots to fix before we can get this thing running” </p>

<p>Sans explained which let out an annoyed sigh from Jevil before Mugman whispered another idea to Jevil which got Jevil excited to run ahead to do just that, must be some other game they are playing to let the rest keep up at work on this. “This has got to work, it has to! Otherwise wh- what will we do then?? We got no clue what other portals could lead us there- HELL! How would we even know the place if so!” Bendy spoke up, staring at the portal frame checking for anything while Baldi was checking to ensure everything was in check to ensure its working which sure did leave thoughts and hopes. Then heard a quiet crash from elsewhere, causing everyone to pause and look over, seeming it came from within the shadows, quickly able to see Jevil place Mugman down before hopping over to stand in front of where the noise was to be ready to guard everyone getting their scythe out and ready for battle. Sans stepped up to join alongside ready for whatever danger could possibly be lurking within the darkness, From what they all learned from being here and around other places there's often something lurking in the shadows, usually a threat at that, but yet, everything remained still, no signs of danger yet, just, silence, like a feeling of being watched from where that sound came from. Till soon something began to slowly step out, looking to be an odd COTS that felt familiar in a sense. </p>

<p>Right away Jevil tried charging in to attack but Mugman stepped in front shouting “WAIT!” causing Jevil to pause in place, scythe out and still ready to fight. Mugman stood in front causing everyone to be confused but yet the odd COTS wasn’t attacking, in fact it looked scared but paused staring at Mugman who walked over slowly and spoke up to it once pausing in place to be somewhat closer to it. “You don’t mean any harm, do you?” Mugman asked, seeing the odd COTS look around but look down to Mugman before crouching to his level, seeing them reach for where a mouth usually would be on beings before hearing a voice that sounded quiet, low but messy and distorted, like something that shouldn’t be possible but is. “No…” The COTS replied, speaking at a volume that seemed Mugman was best able to hear, it sure does sound like they don’t seem to know much judging how slow they spoke, like they were trying to figure and know the correct wording. “I had a feeling! What brings you here then?” Mugman asked which can see this odd COTS study around seeing everyone start to back down except Jevil still ready to fight that Sans had to lower Jevils scythe down to indicate there is no danger which Jevil was hesitant but listened, which let the odd COTS step out from the shadows and quietly moved their way over to where the portal frame was seeing how their feet dragged along like many COTS but instead the arms hanging down they had them held up close to their chest like it was a fear of being hurt in some way, they then looked to the rest and tried to speak up again this time there voice more shaky and mumbled. “No… w-wwworrrk..” The COTS then tried to gesture to what needs to be fixed trying to seem to say how the portal should come out as but it was hard to decipher what they’re saying, except Baldi seemed to understand what was being said despite just only gestures and trying to draw shapes with their fingers in the air. </p>

<p>“They’re saying the portal comes out strong and powerful, too close to the ground can cause it to likely break it or tear out the ground right from us if not careful. So we got to lift it” Baldi explained which right away Sonic zoomed over to do so seeing Jevil join to take on the other side and lift the frame further up, having Bendy go over to help out be the extra strength as Sans and Mugman slid in some tables on the corners to keep the frame held up leaving space for the portal to show up within, which once stepping back to see can see the COTS and Baldi nodded upon seeing this for results. Then the COTS walked over to study it and gestured to the spot that was missing the gem that was meant to go there, in which Bendy seemed to go over taking the necklace off for where his bowtie kept it up like it was around the neck when he doesn’t really have one to then have Baldi go over to lift Bendy up higher so he can place it right in safely and ensure its secured in but not too secured so it can still slip right out before Bendy got placed back down as everyone studied it, now the matter of turning it on, which none of them seemed to exactly know how except it seems the COTS did in some sense, seeming to be going through some the drawers picking up a paper very carefully then searched more to grab a pencil holding it carefully then bringing it over to the rest to hand to them. Sonic got hold of it studying it then looking to the COTS to try and figure out what they mean seeing them do gestures that didn’t make too much sense before Baldi translated. “They said to write down the universe's name we want to travel to before throwing the paper in. Alright, so the name was The Inbetween Universe, right?” Baldi looked to the rest to confirm seeing everyone nod as Sonic began to write that down ready to throw it in before Baldi stopped him, taking the paper to study it. “...’Da Inn beeteen’?” “Wh- NO THAT SAYS THE IN BETWEEN! DUH!” Sonic tried to defend his poor spelling in which Baldi took the pencil from Sonic to rewrite it properly before handing it back to Sonic who seemed embarrassed about his failure in writing. </p>

<p>Before then seeing the COTS gesture to Sonic to fold it up before throwing it in which Sonic did, making sure the ways clear and then threw it into where the portal frame is seeing the portal spark to life with a glow from the gem and spots in the frame for cracks to show its strong glowing energy zapping the paper and creating a portal large and strong its colorations different from ones alike to the others around being mostly blue with settle whites around, causing everyone to look amongst each other before seeing Jevil went ahead to look in then to the rest to gesture for them to follow as they fully hopped in, seeing the COTS put a hand inside to hold the portal open for them letting everyone head right in one by one, Sans heading in then Mugman and Sonic after then Baldi but Bendy took a second, studying around the area then to the gem keeping the portal open, seeming to reach and take it out from the frame and place the gem onto the necklace back onto himself, seeing the portal remain open but looks to be starting to try and vanish, which Bendy went ahead in giving the COTS a smile for the help before fully entering as the COTS studied around at the place before slowly entering soon after as the portal then shut closed behind them, leaving nothing but a now dull empty area of the remains of a portal frame left behind to age with the world its in. </p>

<hr class="new2">


<p>The two walked on for a while, going from floor to floor seeming to be heading up in this massive place, keeping quiet often even having to hide in spots for seems the further they went up the more they saw COTS patrolling the halls, but luckily never found them seeming Stiex knew all the exact spots to hide within as they went onward, which they have reached a clearing spot but can hear what seems like a sound of sort, almost alike to music, music that sounds almost like 70s jazz but not any song she can recognize, it was almost like this world made those types of songs more unique and alike to its own thing but still can be recognized as such. Brook and Stiex slowly went down to figure out the source of the sound, finding a room with the door cracked open to see what it looked like.. Oh no, it’s all four of those people who really caused problems, Clubtacka, Luradis, Uvilein and Balaur.. They all seemed to have most of their injuries cleaned up and bandaged from before and it appears they all are hanging out, Uvilein being strange dancing with the music and singing chaotically while Clubtacka watched confused as Balaur and Luradis were all cuddled against each other laughing at Uvilein and seeming to be all giggly with each other too as the source for where the music came from seemed to be from this old radio that looks it should’ve been tossed away by now but is kept for who knows why. As Stiex seemed to sneak on by past it, Brook stayed nearby to listen in on what was happening or being talked about. “You are such a bad singer, Uvilein!” Luradis chuckled, as seems Balaur joined to pitch in with that with a “Please! That old ass radio here sings far better than him!” which caused Luradis to laugh and Uvilein looking at the two with annoyance. </p>

<p>“OH SUREEEE! LIKE YOU TWO CAN DO ANY BETTER! Which is a wonder why AREN’T you HMMM? Oh righttt! Because you two were both busy having f- HEY HEY- CLUBTACKA DON’T TOUCH THAT JUNK!” Uvilein quickly blocked Clubtacka who tried to grab the old radio which Clubtacka seemed so confused about being stopped. “WHY STOP?? IT TOO BROKEN! SO WE GET RID-” “OH NO! Nottt this one! You know our boss would KILL us if we got rid of it! Calls this junk his most prized possession or whatever!” Uvilein explained to Clubtacka in which Balaur began to laugh. “Just like you with your little crappy inventions!” “HEY!! MY BABIES ARE CAPABLE OF SO MUCH! You should be thanking me for I not only gave you guys inventions to go from place to place BUT I MADE THE MACHINES TO THOSE PORTALS FOR EVEN US TO GET THIS FAR!” Uvilein barked back at Balaur who rolled their eyes at him. “Well not really for that other scientist who shows up to often ‘assist’ and they seem to do FARRR more work than you!” Luradis added, causing Balaur to holler with laughter at that and leave Uvilein even far more annoyed at the two. As Brook moved closer to hear more can feel something quickly yoink her back causing her to look to see Stiex’s tail pull Brook away and force to calm along to sneak by the door and all which Brook followed which as the two walked, the door slightly creaked from the settle wind that went by from them both because of having to hurry a bit by, that’s not good especially when can hear silence soon after from that room. “WHO THERE!? SHOW SO I CAN PUMMEL YOU!!” Clubtackas voice shouted to try and threaten if anyone was there which they don’t know if anyone is but they can’t have themselves known, quickly seeming to hurry by to leave the hall and enter a different one, seeing Stiex go to one the paintings in this hall, pulling on the frame of it to reveal a hidden door, letting Brook quickly hop in and Stiex soon after closing it behind them as they entered what seems like a hidden room, though doesn’t seem to have any other entrances to places aside from the one they came in, must be a hiding place if so. Then they can hear what sounds like people walking around hearing small chatter of seeming the four got up and are scanning around to see what is there before hearing then what sounds like a speaker come on from around the area outside there. “There appears to be a missing prisoner of ours having escaped from their cell. Find her, If you don’t find MY very key to discovering more about these gems I WILL ensure pain comes to you all too. Don’t fail me.” The voice was familiar, it was that Storsi guys voice, hearing the group pause before sounding they all began to split up ways to search, hearing one going right by where they were searching around but seemed to not be aware of this hiding spot so luckily they didn’t think to check, but that sure leaves a problem now if they are roaming around. Stiex took a peek outside the way they came in to study the halls outside before opening it more to head out, making sure Brook followed with while doing so, seeing Stiex then quickly open a door not far from them gesturing Brook to go in, which Brook did step in, studying the room a bit before turning around to see Stiex close the door on her not going in with, which Brook tried to open and ask what he's doing but it wouldn’t budge, confusing her before hearing a voice speak. </p>

<p>“I will take care of the rest, just head forwards and you'll find one of the machines.” Stiex answered before sounds he walked off which Brook tried to thank them but seems he was already gone in seconds for a sound of seeming he suddenly was gone like he moved at some high speed to head elsewhere, leaving Brook to turn around and look ahead down a darker hallway that must lead somewhere, just herself again, but she's almost at one the machines, maybe if she can make it summon a portal to the rest.. But who knows truly if that would even work, but for now, she went onwards into the darkness, ready to face for whatever could be ahead, just her with a goal, to finish this all and if the rest can find a way here, as she then made it out from the darkened hall into a wider space that presented her with a large looming machine glowing with magic and power and faced with the center of it having its power source floating around before her, a gem. </p>

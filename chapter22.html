<h2>Chapter 22. New world, New goal</h2>

<p>The ground was solid, it felt freshly clean as for what can be heard around was silence aside from the slight sound of noise of some sorts perhaps of stuff going around, opening their eyes, can see white brick walls and the floor was this buttermilk like color but was all so odd looking, which carefully sitting up, Sans looked around and saw Baldi who was on the ground as well and the rest seemed to be nowhere to be found, this is situational. “Hey, Baldi, are you alright from that?” Sans asked, getting up and going over to Baldi, who was waking up a bit from the fall and looked to Sans trying to figure out what was happening. “Err… I’m alright… Just my head hurts is all.” Baldi explained, looking around as he sat up and took Sans’s offer to help him up onto his feet as well. “Any idea where we are by chance?” Sans asked once Baldi was on his feet and made sure they were able to stand alright a little bit before studying the area once again. Baldi studied the area to which he was taking a second and which it seems he realized where they were very quickly, studying the place around and even saw one the doors that were a vibrant blue and had the number 99 on it, seeing him open it then close it looking to Sans now. </p>

<p>“This is the universe I'm from, which is odd they will even think to send us here but, despite that it means we can at least figure out where we are, maybe if we are lucky the rest could be here too.” Baldi looked to Sans explaining what he knows which Sans nodded upon hearing that, guess there on another journey now. Baldi quickly began figuring whereabouts they are in this place seeing him check a few the halls they’re nearby before then began to lead the way making sure Sans followed, the two began to walk on through this place and study around, which yet at times a COTS may appear but quickly Sans handled them while Baldi made sure it wouldn’t risk hurting either of them. They walked on, the area looked quite damaged almost like due to the space there isn’t much room even for a few the COTS here just banging back and forth between stuff but it made it easy to handle them due to that, which yet the place felt loud in some ways, hearing the COTS scream from around the place hearing they could be going after one another or other people which yet Baldi didn’t seem bothered by the noise and was focused though Sans surely wasn’t to much but focused on going forward anyway. As they walked it felt like a maze except Baldi knew where they were going in it luckily but it felt so confusing. Who knows if they will find the rest at this point, which Sans was yet beginning to worry about them on if they’re okay or even here, huh, he didn’t before worry about them too much and now? Guess he’s warmed up to them. </p>

<p>“Hey, Sans? You seem to be thinking about stuff and wanted to double check if you’re alright.” Baldi spoke up suddenly which yet interrupted Sans from thinking all about that stuff to listen to what Baldi had to say. “I’m alright, just wondering if we’d find the rest if they’re even here. Kinda different being away from them, guess I’ve gotten used to traveling with them.” Sans answered and he decided to be a bit honest with it since Baldi does seem like someone who won’t go telling people anyway about these things. “I’m sure they’re around here, by the sounds of it though those people must be important to you in some way huh?” Baldi asked, which made Sans pause upon hearing that he isn’t sure what to think of if they are important to him, perhaps in a way they are? Though that is a bit much to say isn’t it? “Well, when you’ve been going on this journey this whole time with them guess in a way they are.” Sans answered Baldi which Baldi took note of that it seemed as they walked on. “Seems you are all friends in some way, It’s nice to see that, how did you even come across them anyway?” Baldi asked Sans as Sans was gonna go questioning the friend thing then the next question came up, maybe he’d ask about it after. </p>

<p>“Well, Mugman we helped out in one of the universes who then came along, Brook was one me and Bendy saved who kinda started this journey thing, as for Bendy… Well, when the chaos only started he fell right in the back of the house, once I helped him out get to somewhere more safe and he felt okay he started following me around, having a will to go around and check everything, guess it explains why he helped Brook encourage me to go on this journey thing to stop this chaos.”  Sans explained which yet can hear Baldi listen in which to think they’ve all been on this journey together for quite a while remembering all of what they’ve seen and who they met, guess maybe they all are kind of friends in this case, which isn’t that bad of a thought now. “Hm, well we’re doing this for a good reason, I wouldn’t want to lose anyone when this is happening so stopping it should help allow many to be safe.” Baldi continued on leading the way, checking a few rooms to check if the rest could be in them which Sans upon hearing it just was reminded about his brother, who fell into a portal like how others have, it’s a wonder what universe he is even in right now and even a hope he’ll be okay, he doesn’t want to lose someone close to him again after all. </p>

<p>“Guess we just have to hope we don’t fail.” Sans added, quietly thinking now to himself which yet Baldi seemed to notice quite quickly as he was going to question it before stopping in front of some doors, studying the yellows doors that stood in front of them that yet when Baldi tested, wouldn’t open, which Baldi realized quickly why and began to check one the nearby rooms. “Hang on, it’s one of these doors that only open from one side, I can quickly change it real quick to help us pass on by, mind keeping watch in case as I get this done?” Baldi asked Sans for if that's possible he can do that which made him pay attention to it. “Aye, aye captain.” Sans in instinct joked a bit which Baldi seemed amused by as he went into one the rooms to a spot that seems to have the wirings and stuff to the door, which Sans stepped out from the room and kept watch around now, simple enough, luckily there isn’t to many COTS around anyway which although odd at least makes the search easier versus the previous universe having so many to fight. Which Sans walked a bit around checking the halls in case hearing Baldi at work on trying to get the door to change direction, which as Sans watched can hear a sudden screech, causing him to look and see a COTS speeding towards being able to only slightly notice the lack of arms it had but before more can be figured Sans quickly dodged seeing it dash by and pause once in front of the wall, being able to properly notice it seems like some other special like one similar to how the flying COTS are and that brute COTS, seeing it turn and as it was about to dash can see a bunch of- well, it looked like suits for a card like a diamond, a club, a spade and a heart. </p>

<p>Sans began to go down the hall to check seeing someone dressed in black and purple looking like a jester but the species they are is hard to figure, not exactly elf like but had the ears of one but the rest seemed strange even with the tail being either J shaped or T shaped. Which can notice this jester looking at some people who were having a chance to run seeing them try to go after them, causing Sans to quickly summon a bone wall to block his way from there, oh so they’re just attacking for fun, can’t let anyone get hurt then if so. Can see the jester had paused and turned to him with a large smile on there face that was showing the jesters pointed teeth seeing how they held a weapon of some kind that looks to be a scythe but to notice there gloves looked ripped up from probably attacking so much for who knows how long now. “OH HO HO! HEE HEE HEE! LOOKIE HERE, HERE! A BONE MAN IS TRYING, TRYING TO SAVE SOME TARGETS,TARGETS! HEE HEE HEE! OH HOW NICE, NICE YOU MUST BE! THINK FAST!” Suddenly the jester after having spoken up now threw the scythe at Sans, causing Sans to dodge quickly, seeing it hit into the wall behind him for where the jester's other attacks were. “Not the way you introduce yourself to anyone you know?” Sans spoke up, readying some bone attacks, guess he’d have to at least keep this jester away from things. </p>
<p>“OH HO HO! THEN JUST KNOW ME AS JEVIL, JEVIL! TO KNOW WHAT THE LAST,LAST NAME YOU’LL BE HEARING!” The jester known as Jevil decided to actually give his name, preparing some more of those suits as well as summoning another one of those scythes. “Alright Jevil, names Sans, and don’t go thinking you’re just going to win this without knowing who you’re fighting.” Sans introduced himself preparing a blaster just in case things go wrong, which yet seemed Jevil was entertained to see that now. “SANS THE WORD FOR WITHOUT,WITHOUT! LET’S MAKE IT MORE ACCURATE THAN!” Suddenly quickly Jevil threw all the suits he had at Sans which Sans quickly encountered throwing bones back at them all, which Jevil charged at him, swinging but yet Sans dodged while making the blaster shoot at Jevil but spun there scythe to use it as a shield to block the beam, not bad of a blocker. Sans quickly ready to throw more bones but Jevil turned his tail into a scythe during this to hit them away and hit Sans back, making the blaster finish as he quickly spun and began to swing at Sans which Sans was managing to dodge each one quickly before summoning a blaster in front of him to block one the swings right back and push Jevil back with it before shooting again, but yet saw Jevil quickly hop up and onto the blaster, throwing suits right into the eye of it causing it to spin out of control going everywhere, making Sans quickly put up a bone wall around himself to protect himself from the beams of the blaster before it stopped as Sans put the bone wall down was quickly tackled down to the ground as Jevil held a scythe above him laughing like a maniac as he did. </p>

<p>“Where’d you learn to fight like this? Your parents by chance?” Sans asked, seeing if that could throw them off, which Jevil paused once hearing that, actually noticing how there was a yellow eye of sorts in his eyes for a second looking at him as if remembering something not so pleasant before it went away and he swung in anger. “OH HO HO WE,WE ARE THROWING INSULTS NOW!” Jevil shouted as Sans rolled out and dodged it all quickly, summoning a bone to hit back against his scythe to keep him backed off. “TELL ME,ME! WHAT'S GOT YOU FIGHTING,FIGHTING SO AGGRESSIVELY? AFRAID TO FAIL PERHAPS AGAIN,AGAIN?” Jevil spoke back which hearing did not help Sans out in this case, god he doesn’t want to be reminded of that day, not right now, which yet quickly made him push Jevil back into the wall and summon a blaster quickly during this. “Alright, I get it what was said was harsh before, we’re even now.”  Sans spoke up as the blaster shot out but Jevil quickly spun his scythe to block it again as he threw several sorts of suits at Sans to try and get him during this. Sans quickly dodged each of the suits throwing bones at Jevil seeing Jevil used them to quickly hop up above the blaster beam that stopped but couldn’t vanish for Jevil got on top of it and controlled it with his scythe to shoot at Sans who quickly had to try and dodge each one but had to put up a bone wall to block it now due to how much of it there was, which gave Jevil a chance to charge in once the blast just broke some the bone wall before it went away to swing at Sans, but Sans was prepared having bones shoot up from the ground to counter the swings and send him back. </p>

<p>Sans quickly then summoned a bone into his hand to quickly throw and get Jevil stuck to one the nearby walls as he put bones around to stop him which he tried suits to back him off but yet he dodged them as he was face to face with Jevil now who tried to swing but Sans summoned a bone into his hand to block it and hold it back. “Look, I really don’t see a point in fighting like everyone in existence is in danger and could already die at the hands of some evil mastermind. Which to consider, you could help out with that.” Sans spoke up while Jevil was still trying to swing at him but yet was looking at him able to tell they’re thinking on what’s been said. “OH PLEASE,PLEASE! YOU JUST WANT A BREAK,BREAK DO YOU? JUST SO YOU CAN WIN THIS GAME,GAME! HAHA! YOU AMUSE ME,ME! BUT I WON”T FALL FOR SUCH TRICKS,TRICKS!” Jevil was surely amused not believing that Sans really thought he could help but, Sans still thinks maybe, just maybe, that Jevil could even if they’re strange, for how hard they fight it could help, something tells him to try after all. “No, I do really think you could help, no tricks are involved in this, besides could help you be someone your own and not just well- someone you wouldn’t want to be huh?” Sans answered Jevil's concerns in some way which he seemed to listen to upon hearing that even the last bit, seeing how he was processing it, seeing his eyes have those yellow dots for a moment. Least this gave Sans a break as Jevil was clearly thinking, before suddenly summoning suits to throw Sans away as he readied his scythe again. “QUIT SAYING,SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT!” Jevil shouted as he swung at Sans rapidly which Sans kept dodging till Jevil got him stuck to the wall hitting the scythe into his hood to make him stuck there and be unable to escape which did put Sans a bit up from the ground as he was slipping a bit out from his hood. Jevil then summoned some suits but paused seeing his arms, sure they’re normal skeleton arms but to notice one wore an orange bracelet of sorts with some orange heart charm tied to it which Jevil studied a little then looked at him. “WELL,WELL! LOOKIE THIS! WHAT'S THIS FROM? A DEAR LOVED,LOVED ONE? BET SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEM,THEM TOO HUH?” Jevil spoke up to get his revenge on what Sans said before even if Sans was not trying to remind him of anything bad, which yet this was surely a harsh thing to say. God it makes Sans remember again what happened, makes him remember them, their state, and this thing he wears, the one thing that clued to what happened to her which he just wears since it really just represents her and… God he needs to focus. </p>

<p>As he was readying to summon bones, he noticed Jevil staring at him, guess Jevil noticed his silence, like he was seeing now for a moment what's happening. “...WELL… …TOO FAR?” Jevil asked, seeing the yellow dots in his eyes during this, like he was not meaning to do this. “Eh, guess we both did huh?” Sans spoke up, which Jevil studied before taking the scythe out of the wall watching Sans drop to the ground now as he studied the scythe now during this. “...WHY DO YOU WANT MY HELP,HELP ANYWAY?” Jevil asked, giving a look that showed somewhat curiosity which Sans got up as Jevil asked this, quite the question really. “Well, there's a lot going on currently and the people I am with are trying their best most the time in battles, could use some more help since so far for what’s been encountered throughout this journey keeps getting stronger, plus the way you fight could help, especially when you got more energy then I would for things clearly.” Sans explained which Jevil was now properly listening it seems to it, seeing him study Sans closely while resting the scythe on there shoulder currently as he looked to him thinking before speaking up. “YOU KNOW,KNOW IT IS NOT EVERY DAY THIS HAPPENS,HAPPENS! HAHA! EVEN WHEN,WHEN YOU’RE STUCK IN FREEDOM ALL ALONE,ALONE! THOUGH, FOR WHAT YOU’VE BEEN SAYING, SAYING REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING I FORGOT,FORGOT OF! HEE HEE HEE! I THINK YOU CAN GET,GET IT!” </p>

<p>Jevil laughed a little at the last bit but it wasn’t to be rude no, it was just something that seemed to be more cheery, which Sans was a little confused by but yet rolled with it, after all, he’s managing to deal with Jevil from causing chaos and yet also getting some extra help for all of this stuff that’s going on. “Well, by the sounds of this sounds like you are willing to help out now with this?” Sans asked which Jevil was thinking for a moment as they spun their scythe around for fun as they thought then looked at Sans with a grin. “WILL I BE ABLE,ABLE TO HURT PEOPLE,PEOPLE? SHOW THEM PAIN,PAIN?” Jevil grinned more as he asked which Sans gave Jevil a bit of a stern look. “You only are going to hurt those that are wielding COTS- or so shadowy figures, not hurt others who are innocent.” Sans answered which Jevil sighed a little causing Jevil to begin to think again if this is a good idea or not to go with to help. “WHAT WILL I WIN,WIN IN RETURN FOR THIS GAME,GAME?” Jevil asked which Sans now had to think for this, what will he get if things go well? Well Sans knows he would get in return a way to save his brother from dangers and hopefully there's an easier way of finding him after that, Bendy said he’d be able to get to have a proper home, Mugman said it will help his family be okay, Brook who knows he isn’t sure and for Baldi to guess it will help everyone in his universe so… “You get to be even more free, get to discover who you are by chance, even a chance at being able to deal with bad people where nobody will stop you for it.” Sans answered hoping that’s a good enough answer which had Jevil thinking again now upon hearing it, can tell they really are trying to consider if it would be a good idea or not to do this. “YOU KNOW SOMETHING,SOMETHING TICKLES ME TO COME ALONG,ALONG! BUT I WILL JUDGE,JUDGE FOR TIME WISE!” Jevil answered, going over to Sans to study him as he then smiled upon looking at him after saying it with that chaotic smile. “Well, as long as you’re willing to help with this then alright.” Sans answered which yet Jevil laughed hearing as he made the scythe disappear for now into nothing as he went by Sans studying around. “PERFECT! NOW! WHERE’S OUR FIRST,FIRST VICTIM?” Jevil asked which Sans looked to Jevil then ahead beginning to lead now which he found Jevil was closely following. “Well, right now we got to regroup with everyone, get back to Baldi who is helping us in this, then we continue to search for the rest of the group, during then you can deal with any COTS that charge over, which COTS as I briefly mentioned are just figures that act like shadows kind of while being aggressive too.” Sans explained which Jevil listened in to then quickly readied now for any enemies after the explanation. “ALRIGHT PERFECT,PERFECT!” Jevil laughed as he shot out suits for fun into a wall. </p>

<p>Sans led the way as Jevil followed closely as soon as they reached back to where Sans was before they saw Baldi testing the door and seeing it now open and Baldi turned around seeing Sans which they were about to say something but noticed right away Jevil behind them. “Sans. Who’s following you?” Baldi asked right away pointing to Jevil who was behind him while Sans looked to Jevil seeing Jevil was reading a scythe thinking to attack not Sans but Baldi but Sans quickly made Jevil lower it down to tell him no. “This is Jevil, Which at least for right now could help stop us with this stuff that is going on.” Sans explained which Jevil gave a wide grin that made Baldi unsettled a little and looked to Sans confused a bit but yet let out a sigh since it’s fair anyways especially with these current circumstances. “Well alright then, Hi Jevil, I am Baldi. And-” “HEE HEE HEE! YOU LOOK SO SILLY,SILLY! LIKE AN DEFORMED EGG,EGG!” Jevil interrupted with some laughter which Baldi was unphased by though annoyed he got interrupted but yet focused again at the task at hand. “Well. Let’s continue onward, should try reaching a central area at least to see if the others are there by chance or if anything there can be of help currently.” </p>

<p>Baldi explained the plan which Sans agreed with making Baldi begin to lead the way which Sans and Jevil followed now, although it’s odd to have this new team member in a way, they could hopefully help a little. As they went on, they noticed down some the halls there are quite a few COTS which Baldi led to dodge them which Sans followed but noticed Jevil watching one the halls and summoning some suits as they got their scythe ready, having a big grin on their face. Sans was about to tell them to not but saw Jevil quickly throw suits down and charge down the hall causing the other COTS from the other halls to notice them now. Baldi looked down each hall studying where they’re all coming from which Sans quickly began to shoot bones and blasters down some the halls while can notice Jevil quickly dashing to each one quickly making fast work of every COTS that showed up in those halls. Baldi was quick to go to some the nearby rooms grabbing some stuff and can see how he locked the doors for one the halls preventing the COTS from coming from while quickly shaking a soda to shoot some back right into Jevils scythe that he was swinging around like crazy while quickly throwing what seemed to be was a banana peel in one watching some COTS slip towards and was quickly shot by a blaster once entering the other hall due to it. </p>

<p>Till all the COTS were now quickly handled with leaving the three standing there tired out, well, more so Baldi and Sans kinda were but Jevil still had plenty of energy afterwards. “UEE HEE HEE! THAT WAS FUN,FUN! IT FELT GOOD,GOOD I CAN GO FOR THAT AGAIN,AGAIN!” Jevil exclaimed as he looked at the two which at least says that Jevil is enjoying doing some good stuff to help out in this. “Next time don’t try attacking anyone if there is danger we are sneaking by” Sans spoke up which Jevil stared at trying to decide if to listen or not, or, was he watching behind them, till quickly saw Jevil dash by and stab there scythe through a COTS that must’ve been speeding towards them, making quick work of it and looked to Sans and Baldi now. “DONE!” Jevil smiled happily going back over which was quietly appreciated how Jevil did kind of save them from being attacked so suddenly, which yet Baldi said a quick Sans and began to lead which Sans gave a bit of a thanks as well once Jevil came back over as he began to follow Baldi and Jevil followed right after. They continued on going through all sorts of different halls and really noticing Jevil just quickly attack each enemy they come across as they walked on which at least made this easier to get through and plus with how much energy Jevil has was surely helpful for them all since Sans and Baldi probably would’ve been exhausted at this point if it weren’t for Jevil, which soon it seems Baldi stopped reaching a spot that seems could be the center of this place but it seems awfully quiet upon standing there, seeing how he studied around and was listening in. </p>

<p>“WHAT ARE WE DOING,DOING?” Jevil asks, looking at Baldi then to Sans, obviously confused by what’s going on. “I am listening in currently to hear if anyone else is around, just give me a second and I will tell you what I hear.” Baldi explained as he took a moment to begin to listen in to what's around him, which Jevil and Sans watched but kept watch around in case any dangers tried to creep up on them. Jevil was visibly getting bored just swinging around there scythe for fun then looked to Sans having a grin grow on there face as they held up there scythe to aim to attack him, which Sans quickly blocked it with some bones right as Jevil swung and just was annoyed it didn’t work making him not try again, which then can notice Baldi now was looking in a direction perhaps having tracked something now. “They’re here, They’re just at the farther ends of this place. Alright, come on.” Baldi spoke up, quickly beginning to lead the way which Sans and Jevil began to follow now, the rest are here, that’s some good luck there now it’s a matter of finding them, which they quickly went onward, Jevil rushing ahead readying to attack anything which once it came to a few hallways, Jevil bolted down the wrong one which Baldi went onward to the correct one as Sans had to stop to summon a blaster to bring Jevil over to guide him to the correct hallway which Jevil laughed upon being picked up by the blaster when it happened. </p>

<p>They went onward until soon they all came a stop once going through some the halls and came across a larger long hallway, but yet can see some COTS that were there in the hall flee away as a portal opened in a spot within it, seeing someone step out from it as the portal closed behind once they have stepped out, which Jevil was readying to go attacking but Sans and Baldi kept Jevil back to study who this was. Can see this person seemed almost human but their body was odd shapes of sorts circling into themselves, the assumed top they wore was a bright red while the assumed pants that are there was a vintage maroon coloration along with black pair of boots. Can see there head was odd for being mostly white but the nose a pale-ish color while what was odd blackened shapes came out from atop their head like horns, perhaps they are horns, who truly can tell as can see now this person look to them quickly seeing their pupils of sorts were all scribble like but clear of what is there, which yet to realize this person was watching them and who knows if they got any good business here or not. “It appears there are still some people.” This person made up of mostly shapes spoke, which yet Baldi and Sans quickly got a bad vibe from, which Jevil noticed their reactions and quickly tried to go attack but Sans kept Jevil back once again. </p>

<p>“You don’t seem like you fell in here like others have.” Baldi spoke up, looking at the person who looked back at Baldi, able to tell they’re studying them for a second before focusing. “Good observation. I’m just here to do my job. Though sorry I will have to do this.” The person quickly then snapped their fingers and can see COTS come dashing in coming to the sides of this person able to see odd red swirls and other odd shaped swirls be around the COTS almost like a way for them to command them, which yet meant this person was ready to right away try and start a fight, which Baldi looked to Sans and Jevil which Sans gave a nod and looked to Jevil who looked to them, smiled widely before charging in as the fight now has begun. </p>
